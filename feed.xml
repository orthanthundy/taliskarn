A “steady week”: everything’s proceeding as planned. Slightly slower than I’d prefer, but at least it’s moving.</p>

<h2 id="technical-updates">Technical updates</h2>
<p>I finally gathered enough experience using my own website to realize: this can’t go on. I dedicated Wednesday and Thursday entirely to technical improvements, resulting in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Navigation overhaul—both desktop and mobile</strong>. Implemented mega-menu support and reorganized sections. It’s still not perfect, but at least it no longer physically hurts me to look at it. This will do for now; I’ll revisit it during beta.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed the site’s mobile view</strong> with minor CSS tweaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Implemented proper wiki-link functionality</strong> with support for tooltips <span class="has-tooltip tooltip-nolink">like these pop-ups<span class="tooltip-content">right here</span></span>. Now I just need to start actually using them, but that’ll be closer to beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also noted a few more technical issues for the future, but that’s for another time.</p>

<h2 id="finished-the-verdant-verdas">Finished the Verdant Verdas</h2>
<p>Well… “finished” might be an exaggeration. Let’s call it “escaped.”</p>

<p>The great steppes of Verda have always been a stumbling block for me. I can <em>feel</em> them deeply, but for some reason, describing and expressing their vibe has proven elusive. After a few frustrating days trying to “describe on a Varmego-level something I don’t fully understand” I just threw my hands up and moved on. I completed alpha versions of all the regions, knowing I’ll have to revisit them later, with a more furrowed brow, during beta.</p>

<p>Completed (<em>no direct links, as content keeps updating—find these in “Places → Verdant Verdas”</em>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>More detailed texts for Narem, Orem, Cape Kapar, the Eastern Shore, the Chillbay, and the cities of Marcolo, Duerbo, and Buso.</li>
  <li>Solkalor’s Tread Canyon.</li>
  <li>The Coppergrass Plains, including Khuur-Tyr Pillars, the disappearing river Stelitri, Lake Koro, and the cities of Shisurr and Shi-Hangar.</li>
  <li>The Rumbling Steppes and the city of Shi-Undor.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in alpha, some quite early-stage. Still, the Lands of Verda are essentially done! Next up is the Warm Sea.</p>

<p><em>Actually, there’s still one small exception: I need to separate the eastern part of the Coppergrass Plains, beyond the Malvarmari—the planned “Barrowlands.” Not sure yet; I might return there in beta or perhaps even this coming week.</em></p>

<h2 id="art-updates">Art Updates</h2>
<p>“One does not simply draw feet”. I’m trying my best, but they keep eluding me. Nevertheless, I added a few new bestiary illustrations and completed two crucial portraits: Ronan and Barghyr, key characters for the planned narrative. Next up is Ismeria—I suspect her intricate jewelry will give me quite a headache.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-coming-week">Plans for the Coming Week</h2>
<p>The Warm Sea awaits. I’d love to fully complete it within the week.</p>

<p>Until next week!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally escaped from the lands of Verda, fixed navigation and mobile views, drew Barghyr and Ronan—progress continues.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Diaries, Issue 7</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Diaries, Issue 7" /><published>2025-04-08T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2025-04-08T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-7</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-7/"><![CDATA[<p>All week I had the feeling I was going in circles, getting nothing done (<em>mystery: there are no deadlines, and yet I’m still late</em>), barely moving forward. But today I sat down to take stock and realized: not true at all — I’ve made great progress. That’s why you keep a dev log. Worth it :)</p>

<h2 id="the-saltuars">The Saltuars</h2>

<p>As planned, I first dove deep into expanding and refining the saltuaric peoples. I completed the <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars/largars">Largars</a> and the <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars/oremians">Oremians</a> — customs, traditions, settlements, cultural code, etc. Developed to a solid enough level that I don’t need to revisit them unless I’m prepping adventures in the region (or writing book events set there). The only saltuars left are the Sudians, but they’ll have to wait until I get to the Warm Sea. That path’s a long one.</p>

<h2 id="varmego">Varmego</h2>

<p>Ah, <a href="/malkona/verda/capar/varmego">Varmego</a>… Honestly, it took a <em>titanic</em> act of will just to start it: the Shield City is impregnable in every sense. It’s easily the most difficult location to design in all of Malkona — which currently makes it the hardest in all of Taliskarn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>40–50k residents, highly mixed: Prymars, Malnurs, Oremians, and travelers from all over Verda;</li>
  <li>500 years of history that needs at least a broad-strokes outline — essential to understand how the city developed;</li>
  <li>Three concentric “Rings,” each a self-contained city-within-a-city — totally different, yet bleeding into each other;</li>
  <li>Dozens of districts.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this needs culture, a map, hooks for quests — and it all has to tie in with the Prymarate at the very least. Another vicious circle: Varmego affects all the Shorelands, and the Shorelands all feed back into Varmego. Nightmare fuel.</p>

<p>I spent three full days on the capital and barely wrapped it up by the third evening. But I’m happy with the result: it’s something I can show without shame — and more importantly, a major milestone is behind me. Unapologetically proud.</p>

<p>Next up is “defeating” the Warm Sea (<em>another melting pot of cultures, just over a broader area</em>), then a bit of suffering in Meza and Baleymore, but none of them rival the glory and scope of the Shield. What a relief :)</p>

<h2 id="the-shorelands-and-a-worldbuilders-systemic-error">The Shorelands and a Worldbuilder’s Systemic Error</h2>

<p>Naturally, Varmego pulled the surrounding region along with it, and here — already burnt out from working on the capital — I fell into a trap. Sat down this morning thinking, “Just one region today, I’m still recovering from Varmego. I’ll get it done and rest.” One hour, two, three, five — and the Shorelands still weren’t done. By hour six, sharp-eyed Ortan started getting suspicious.</p>

<p>Yeah. Turns out, if you take a meta-region nearly 2,000 miles wide and label it “just one region,” that doesn’t actually make it less work. The Shorelands contain five major zones, each with its own flavor, mechanics, and geographic logic. That’s Narem, Orem, Cape Capar, the Eastern Shore, and Chill Bay. I tried to handle them all in one page to avoid splitting them up — no surprise I got bogged down.</p>

<p>And here we hit a systemic issue: what level of detail is appropriate? How deep do you go? You’ve got the Shorelands. But inside that, Narem and Orem are basically standalone regions. But then in Orem, there’s East and West, and the cities of Marcolo and Duerbo — do I split them again? Marcolo has distinct districts… It’s easy to wake up three layers deep describing the color of straw mats in the third house on Fifth Street in Ronangrad, and nobody’s ever going to need that info.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you lump things together too broadly — say, “The Shorelands, the end” — then I lose a strong mental map of the world. Also bad.</p>

<p>Once again I went back to an old principle: <em>flavor above all</em>. If two regions have distinctly different flavor — atmosphere, theme, vibe, call it what you want — and you’d want to play or write different things in each, then split them. If the flavor’s the same or close enough, combine them. That’s why Narem and Orem are separate, but East and West Orem are unified (even if each half is bigger than Narem). Gotta remember that.</p>

<p>So I split the Shorelands into subpages, pushed all relevant content into them, and felt a bit better. New additions to the site:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/malkona/southern_sea">The Southern Sea</a> (<em>well, mostly its bestiary for now — but what a bestiary</em>)</li>
  <li>The meta-region: <a href="/malkona/verda/shorelands">The Shorelands</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/southern_sea/negata">Negata Island</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/narem">Narem</a> and the city of <a href="/malkona/verda/narem/marcolo">Marcolo</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/orem">Orem</a> and the city of <a href="/malkona/verda/orem/duerbo">Duerbo</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/capar">Cape Capar</a> (<em>and <a href="/malkona/verda/capar/varmego">Varmego</a>, of course</em>)</li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/eastern_shore">Eastern Shore</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/chillbay}">Chill Bay</a> and <a href="/malkona/verda/chillbay/buso">Buso</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the next few days I plan to bring them up from “rough outline” to a decent first draft, at least to match the surrounding regions — and then I’ll move north, to the Roaring Steppes and Lake Koro. But first…</p>

<h2 id="navigation-overhaul">Navigation Overhaul</h2>

<p>It’s overdue: the dropdown menu can’t handle the number of pages and nesting levels anymore. An egg in a duck, the duck in a rabbit — getting to Varmego takes 5 clicks through nested menus, and you need a compass to find your way back.</p>

<p>I’ll try to rework it into a megamenu tonight, while also fixing a few long-postponed layout issues. Might get stuck for a couple days, but it needs to be done.</p>

<h2 id="art-things">Art Things</h2>

<p>This one’s going well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, I tried painting Vespeta and actually pulled it off — I’m not fully happy with it, but for a first try, I’m thrilled.</li>
  <li>Second, I did a few quick bestiary sketches: crude, rough, but stylistically <em>exactly</em> what I had in mind. I’ll keep practicing and building the pipeline — I believe it’ll come together.</li>
  <li>Third, I managed to draw Vespeta from a new angle, and she still looks recognizable. That’s progress. You can check it out on Discord, in the art channel (<em>link’s in the header</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic poses and tough angles still aren’t working (<em>honestly, bodies in general aren’t working</em>), but I’m on it. Stay tuned.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-next-week">Plans for Next Week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Redo the website navigation and patch a few minor issues.</li>
  <li>Finish the Shorelands: many of the areas are just placeholders right now, but I’ll flesh them out in the coming days.</li>
  <li>Move on to the Steppes (<em>ideally finish them, but I’ll probably need to rethink some of the Aridar peoples in light of new Varmego lore — not sure how deep that’ll go yet</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>My “I’ll draft the whole world in a month!” plan has officially crashed and burned: the basic drafts just aren’t enough, and the level of detail I <em>do</em> find satisfying is 2–3x the work. But it is what it is — we keep going, and keep aiming high. Hopefully I’ll finish the wiki setup by the first day of summer.</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victory over Varmego, first bestiary sketches, a worldbuilder’s systemic mistake, and technical trouble.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Diaries, Issue 6</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-6/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Diaries, Issue 6" /><published>2025-04-01T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-6</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-6/"><![CDATA[<p>The past week turned out interesting: hard to tell if it’s a success or a failure. On one hand, I strayed far from my plans, but on the other… let me explain step by step.</p>

<h2 id="focused-on-the-peoples">Focused on the Peoples</h2>
<p>Got stuck in a tricky loop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From a worldbuilding logic perspective, regions define peoples, their cultures, etc. So, you need to flesh out regions first, then their inhabitants.</li>
  <li>From a gameplay perspective down the line, the spotlight will often be on the peoples themselves – meaning their uniqueness, identity, and core concepts should come first. The surrounding environment should then align with and enhance these ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>So again, I’m torn about where to start: the more complex the region, the harder it is to choose. Solved the problem simply: a stroke here, a stroke there, gradually shaping the volume and form.</p>

<p>As a result, almost no new regions were added this week, but:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiled all notes on <a href="/denizens/races/prymars">Prymars</a> into a single article – it turned out massive, but thoroughly captures my current vision of them.</li>
  <li>Did the same for <a href="/denizens/races/arydars">Arydars</a> and their three main ethnic groups: <a href="/denizens/races/arydars/kromrs">Kromrs</a>, <a href="/denizens/races/arydars/tondrantars">Tondrantars</a>, and <a href="/denizens/races/arydars/malnurs">Malnurs</a>. Still rough drafts here; will flesh them out in the coming days.</li>
  <li>Revisited <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars/monti">Monti</a>, <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars/senfenns">Senfenns</a>, and <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars/malvars">Malvars</a>. Now satisfied with their details – I clearly see these peoples. Might tweak minor things, but overall, I’ll leave them as-is until beta.</li>
  <li>Also managed to draft another region: <a href="/malkona/verda/windhill_plains">Windhill Plains</a>. Love its core idea and concept, but it’s still a rough draft – feels sparse in places. Still, I’ll postpone further work here for the second iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list seems modest, but the articles themselves hold massive amounts of info – when you think about it, progress is steady.</p>

<h2 id="reached-a-milestone-in-drawing">Reached a Milestone in Drawing</h2>
<p>First, the new tablet made things way more comfortable – happy with it. Second, I’ve more or less nailed head proportions and, I think, found the style I want for Taliaskarn’s basic character illustrations. Currently compiling everything into one concept, working intensely on Vespeta, trying to maintain consistent features across angles. It’s tough, takes ages, but who said it’d be easy?</p>

<h2 id="cut-off-excess-baggage-for-good">Cut Off Excess Baggage for Good</h2>
<p>Fact: the hypothesis of “open development might interest someone” has mostly failed. Discord’s dead; friends joined but lurk silently. Special thanks to Nikolai, who doesn’t even play but is the only one keeping the server alive – always a pleasure!</p>

<p>Can’t blame others:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most info in the drafts isn’t engaging for outsiders: there’s no plot, and a standalone world isn’t compelling – that’s the truth.</li>
  <li>Overload of data: names, terms, references – even I get overwhelmed sometimes.</li>
  <li>Zero motivation from the project’s owner: no contests, polls, or marketing – no effort to engage.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I won’t: I’m certain that trying to involve others now would cost more than it’d gain. Need to focus on fleshing out Malkona and Taliaskarn’s core drafts, then move to novels and systematically polish everything. That’s when we’ll have something presentable for end users. Not yet.</p>

<p>So, freezing Discord. From the project’s info framework, keeping only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A brief update log (moving to a separate channel for archival);</li>
  <li>These daily diaries and progress reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll revisit this in six months.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-coming-week">Plans for the Coming Week</h2>
<p>Today and tomorrow: second iteration on Verda’s peoples – Largars, then Kromrs-Tondrantars-Malnurs. After that, Varmego and the entire Prymarat (southern coast, pulling in the Oremians). Then onward to the Warm Sea shores.</p>

<p>That’s all for now – off to dig into Largar culture. Until next week!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spent a ton of time on the peoples of Verda, very little on everything else, but overall satisfied.

Overall, it was a fairly smooth week, working as usual, but let’s go over things in order.</p>

<h2 id="established-a-content-development-workflow">Established a Content Development Workflow</h2>
<p>Taliskarn — even just the Malkona continent — is pretty vast. I’ll need to write a <em>lot</em> of articles about the regions, peoples, and the world at large. The main problem turned out to be quite simple: it wasn’t clear where to start.</p>

<p>I made a master list of regions — came out to around 40–50 (<em>the exact number keeps shifting as development progresses</em>) zones that definitely deserve their own articles because they’re packed with unique features and flavor. I looked at the list, gave it some thought, and here’s what I came up with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One of the main goals — and at the same time one of the main difficulties — is making the world feel cohesive. Neighboring locations influence each other: economy, politics, geography, wildlife — all interconnected. So when nothing’s written yet, it’s hard to start: you don’t know what’s around, which means you don’t know what affects what.</li>
  <li>I tried starting with a region I’d already thought a lot about during early story planning — the Warm Sea. The idea was simple: “I already have a bunch of material for it, so it should be easier.”</li>
  <li>It wasn’t. The Warm Sea is a very complex region to build: it blends multiple cultures, biomes, and themes. I think it’ll remain tricky even when the surrounding zones are done.</li>
  <li>So I tried a different approach: start with a region that’s the least affected by its neighbors. For example, the Scarred Lands of Bruna (specifically, the Cursed Blood Desert): it’s such a harsh, self-contained area that its surroundings influence it only minimally.</li>
  <li>Then, once you’ve fleshed out a “bright spot on the map,” move on to a neighboring region that <em>is</em> strongly influenced by that one, but not so much by others. For me, that was the Ashen Frontier (<em>I skipped over the desert north of Bruna and the Crumpled Wastes for now, but I have some rough drafts for those that I want to revisit and polish a bit more</em>).</li>
  <li>And so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach worked really well, and I’ve made solid progress — though I didn’t get to cover all of Verda yet, of course.</p>

<h2 id="wrote-up-several-regions-and-articles">Wrote Up Several Regions and Articles</h2>
<p>At the moment, everything’s still in draft/reference format: lots of information, few details, zero literary polish. It’s basically a working outline, but a very valuable one — especially for me. Even at this rough stage, each region takes about 3–5 A4 pages.</p>

<p>Completed (<em>only in Russian for now, the English version is delayed until the beta phase starts</em>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/montwyn_hills">The Montwyn Hills</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/lake_larga">Lake Larga</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/lake_senfunda">Lake Senfunda</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/steps">The Steps</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/verda/lake_malvarma">Lake Malvarma</a></li>
  <li><a href="/malkona/wilderreach">The Wilderreach</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also fleshed out the <a href="/denizens/races/saltuars">Saltuars</a> overall and their six main ethnic groups. Plus, I wrote the <a href="/wonders/spirits">article on the spirit concept in Verda</a>. And the myth and creature list of Malkona has grown with the addition of the Valgarns (see Wilderreach), which I’m really happy about.</p>

<h2 id="still-learning-to-draw">Still Learning to Draw</h2>
<p>Ran into a physical issue: using the iPad hurt my shoulder (when it’s angled more vertically) or my neck (when it’s too horizontal). Not ideal. Switched to a Wacom tablet — now I draw on the desk and look at a monitor. Much more comfortable, though it takes getting used to. Still struggling with anatomy, but I’m happy with the progress. Nothing to show yet, but I can clearly see I’m moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-coming-week">Plans for the Coming Week</h2>
<p>I’ve nearly wrapped up the Saltuar section — just have Sudjo left (<em>which leans more toward the Warm Sea</em>) and the Southern Coast (<em>which is its own thing, heavily influenced by Prymar culture</em>). This week, I’ll try to finish the Arydars — there’s tons of material on them already, just needs formatting — and, ideally, the Prymars too. Then the Southern Coast will also fall into place, and what’ll remain in Verda are the Warm Sea and the Crumpled Wastes + the desert nearby.</p>

<p>And of course, keep drawing. And working. Everything’s moving steadily forward — Taliskarn is growing bit by bit.

Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<h2 id="transitioned-development-to-a-public-stage">Transitioned development to a public stage</h2>

<p>Published the website (in both Russian and English), set up Discord, posted a map and a call for feedback on Reddit in r/worldbuilding — a flop: 14 upvotes and one encouraging comment.</p>

<p>Possible reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The post was stuck in moderation for a day and a half</strong>, and after approval, it immediately sank deep into the feed. Over 5 days, it got 700 views (for comparison, another topic I posted without moderation delays gathered the same number in an hour).</li>
  <li><strong>The map is a WIP</strong>, and r/worldbuilding seems more like a place where people want to talk about <em>their</em> worlds rather than look at someone else’s. Especially an unfinished one. My mistake.</li>
  <li><strong>Maybe it’s just not as cool as I think</strong>. I refuse to consider this option.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, it was a relief: working in isolation for months is psychologically taxing. Now that I’m publishing everything immediately, I feel a sense of progress and completion: <em>do it → post it → feel satisfied</em>. Surprisingly, having a real audience doesn’t impact this feeling much. Getting feedback would be nice, but…</p>

<h2 id="reconsidered-next-steps-for-development-promotion-and-priorities">Reconsidered next steps for development, promotion, and priorities</h2>

<p>If the map post had “blown up” — say, 200+ upvotes, dozens of comments, or even brought a few people to Discord — I’d have felt energized to push the “public worldbuilding” angle further.</p>

<p>Since that didn’t happen, I faced a crossroads: <em>what’s next?</em></p>

<p>Several options emerged. The first — which I considered primary for a couple of days — was to invest time and effort into promoting the project in its current state, seeking alpha readers, etc. Possible tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engage in 3-5 subreddits, actively participate, help others. After a few months, gently promote my project and request feedback.</li>
  <li>Start a blog or YouTube channel. Either chronicling the project (which no one needs) or sharing “DM experience” content to funnel traffic to Taliskarn — but such channels are a dime a dozen, and…</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this feels unpleasant. If I genuinely wanted to engage on Reddit or run a blog, that’d be one thing. But right now, my sole focus is finishing the first Taliskarn books, which consumes all my time and attention. Pretending to be “active and cool” feels hypocritical. I hate this approach.</p>

<p>Plus, I’m working solo with no budget, so any extra tasks steal time from creating the actual product. Bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion (reached yesterday):</strong> Return to the original plan — <strong>no promotion until the first novels are ready</strong>. The website stays up as a workspace and project chronicle. Discord remains as-is. If organic traffic brings someone — great. If not — so be it.</p>

<p><strong>Second conclusion:</strong> Pause the English version to avoid double work. No English audience exists yet, and none will magically appear in the coming months. I’ll translate materials during the pre-beta wiki phase, perhaps. News might still be bilingual (in Discord too — needs more thought).</p>

<h2 id="decided-how-to-handle-feedback">Decided how to handle feedback</h2>

<p>The main issue with the “no promotion until release” approach is the lack of audience and feedback. I pondered solutions, but the answer is brutally simple: <em>there is none</em>.</p>

<p>I can’t hire people. Offering mutual reviews isn’t feasible — no time. Finding genuinely interested folks is vague and time-consuming. Begging friends to “look at my stuff” feels gross. Unfinished, niche work naturally lacks appeal.</p>

<p>I’ll keep working solo. Occasionally, feedback still surprises me: this week, <strong>Nikolai</strong> — unprompted! — gave feedback. Made my day (or two!). Huge thanks to him :)</p>

<p>So, my companion for the coming months is <strong>creative self-reliance</strong>. Write it → post it → reread it the next day → pat myself on the back. <em>“If you want something done, do it yourself”</em> 💪</p>

<h2 id="structured-future-guides">Structured future guides</h2>

<p>After refocusing on core content, I breathed freely. Started organizing planned books:</p>

<p><a href="/about/templates/template_malkona">Guide to Malkona</a><br />
<a href="/about/templates/template_region">Regional Guide</a></p>

<p>Looks solid for now. Structure may change later.</p>

<h2 id="added-regions">Added regions</h2>

<p>Well, one and a half: fleshed out <strong>Brun’s lands</strong> with subregions and details, moved to <strong>Verda</strong>. Published the alpha for <a href="/malkona/verda/ashen_frontier/">The Ashen Frontier</a>. After posting this diary, I’ll tackle the <strong>Monti Hills</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="continued-learning-to-draw">Continued learning to draw</h2>

<p>Nothing major to report. Stuck on skull anatomy. Front and side views are fine, but ¾ angles and rotations stump me. Grinding through it.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-week">Plans for the week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on regions. Ideally, finish <strong>Verda</strong> — but it’s massive.</li>
  <li>Draw. Master skull basics, move to ribcage.</li>
  <li>Day job obligations: a major release is approaching.</li>
</ul>

<p>With that, I conclude another diary entry: <em>thank you, dear diary, for existing! Until next week.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought about the further development of the project, settled on plans for the near future, made a structure for future guides and a couple more regions.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taliskarn Website is Live!

I’m finishing these lines, uploading the site to GitHub Pages, waiting for the domain to connect, and Taliskarn is finally taking its place on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On one hand, it feels a bit early—worldbuilding alone rarely interests people, let alone a rough draft of a world. Even if we assume that the setting is shaping up well, as a reader, I’d still want to see stories and novels set in Taliskarn, and as a player or DM, I’d want adventures and content I can use right away to create my character or campaign. Right now, there’s neither.<br /><br /><br />
Even by my most optimistic plans, it’ll be a few more months before the first finished content from Taliskarn appears online—most likely a novel. And as for fully developed DnD adventures and a guidebook, I wouldn’t expect them before early fall, or even next winter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="so-is-anything-actually-finished">So, is anything actually finished?</h2>
<p>Not quite ^_^. But there are a few pages that are more developed than others, and I’d really appreciate feedback on them.</p>

<h3 id="the-scarred-lands-region">The “Scarred Lands” Region</h3>
<p><a href="/malkona/scarred_lands" target="_self"><strong>Scarred Lands of Bruna</strong></a></p>

<p>At this stage of development, I want all regional and cultural pages to reach a similar level of completeness. A page should provide an overview of what this region is, its core concept, its wonders and points of interest, and who lives there. Broad strokes, but clear and understandable. Key questions for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the page readable? What could be improved?</li>
  <li>Is the region’s concept clear?</li>
  <li>Would you personally be interested in playing in this setting?</li>
  <li>What would you like to change/add/remove?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other thoughts, ideas, or comments are also welcome!</p>

<h3 id="the-bryleahns">The Bryleahns</h3>
<p><a href="/denizens/races/bryleahns" target="_self"><strong>Bryleahns</strong></a><br />
This page will still be expanded and refined, but overall, the major traits of the Bryleahn people are in place. The same questions apply as with Bruna.</p>

<h3 id="malkona-map">Malkona Map</h3>
<p><a href="/malkona#map" target="_self"><strong>Map</strong></a><br />
Any feedback on the map—are the regions readable, how does it feel overall, etc.? I probably won’t be making major changes like “let’s throw in a massive desert here,” but I can and will tweak things on a smaller scale.</p>

<h3 id="wonders">Wonders</h3>
<p><a href="/wonders" target="_self"><strong>Wonders</strong></a><br />
The concept of wonders in Taliskarn. Does it come across well? Is everything clear? Any ideas on how to implement and integrate this into DnD?</p>

<h3 id="myth">Myth</h3>
<p><a href="/extras/stories/myth" target="_self"><strong>Myth</strong></a><br />
This one is for the bravest souls. It covers the fundamental history of Taliskarn—how it was created, how its peoples came to be, and how we ended up where we are now. It might be a bit heavy to read due to its style, but that’s intentional. Again, I’d be grateful for any comments or suggestions—where things seem illogical, what could be added, what’s missing, etc.</p>

<p>For any feedback on these pages—or any others, or really anything related to Taliskarn—I’d be super grateful! Oh, and one more thing…</p>

<h4 id="all-names--overall-english-sound">All Names &amp; Overall English Sound</h4>
<p>My native language is Russian, and I write in it first. While I do my best to make the English version sound and look great, as a non-native speaker, I lack what people call a “feel for the language.” Sometimes I just can’t tell whether something sounds good or awkward. That’s why I’d be especially grateful to native English speakers for any comments on where things feel off, what sounds outright bad, etc.</p>

<h3 id="why-launch-the-website-now-when-theres-not-much-to-show-yet">Why launch the website now, when there’s not much to show yet?</h3>
<p>A few reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To better exploit my alpha readers, <strong>MUHAHAHA</strong>. I share most of what I create with my players and friends—these are people who give me valuable feedback, and I deeply appreciate it.</li>
  <li>Over the next few months, I’ll occasionally ask others to check out the project—people I’ve played with before, friends, the broader Reddit community, etc. It’s convenient to do that by just sharing a link to the site.</li>
  <li>The site itself, along with the structured workflow of developing and updating the project, helps keep me disciplined and focused. Plus, it lets me see everything in a near-final format rather than just a blank Google Doc.</li>
  <li>The sooner, the better. Let the content pile up, let search engines start indexing things, and later, I’ll have a live record of how this idea evolved—so I can look back and tear up sentimentally.</li>
  <li>Who knows? Maybe someone will actually find the worldbuilding process itself interesting—drop by, comment, throw in ideas… That would be amazing 🙂</li>
</ol>

<p>So, from today, Taliskarn enters the phase of semi-public development. Join the Discord, follow project updates (some of you won’t have a choice :devil:), and thanks for being here!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taliskarn is online!

<h2 id="website-updates">Website updates</h2>
<p>I cleaned up the Russian version of the website: removed completely empty pages, fixed most of the internationalization bugs, added table of contents and spoilers to articles, and updated page info to match the latest state of things. In short, the site is now ready for public launch.</p>

<h2 id="drew-non-human-races">Drew non-human races</h2>
<p>Created concepts for <a href="/denizens/races/kyonnhs/" target="_self">Kyonnhs</a>, <a href="/denizens/races/flammars/" target="_self">Flammars</a>, <a href="/denizens/races/kyonnhs/" target="_self">Noctids</a>, plus as a bonus, <a href="/denizens/races/prymars//" target="_self">a Prymar</a> (<em>sounds kinda weird, actually</em>) and <a href="/denizens/races/arydars//" target="_self">an Arydari</a>. They’re all on their respective pages now, published and looking great (according to my mom, at least!).</p>

<h2 id="prepared-the-scarred-lands-section">Prepared the “Scarred Lands” section</h2>
<p>You can check it out <a href="/malkona/scarred_lands" target="_self">here</a>. This is the level of detail I’m aiming for with all regions at this phase – and all peoples will get a similar treatment. I’m open to feedback and critique.</p>

<h2 id="jotted-down-a-bunch-of-notes-on-other-regions">Jotted down a bunch of notes on other regions</h2>
<p>Monsters, wonders, quirks, flavors, and so on. Some places are clear and well-defined in my mind, others are still a bit foggy – that’s just how it goes.</p>

<h2 id="still-learning-to-draw">Still learning to draw</h2>
<p>Finished the theory part of the “Character Drawing” course once, practiced drawing faces. Now I’ve gone back to the start of the course and structured my learning: I’m studying anatomy in parallel (hoping to get a basic grasp in 2-3 months), working on gestures (not making any predictions here), and dabbling with color (just for fun, in the evenings). And I’ll occasionally draw something for Taliskarn at my current level – sketch concepts, that sort of thing. But the focus remains on learning: I want to reach a decent skill level by mid-summer, when I plan to be close to publishing a novel or the first Taliskarn adventure.</p>

<p>Started an Instagram. Will be posting art and progress there.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-coming-week">Plans for the coming week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prepare the English version of the site</li>
  <li>Publish the website (literally today or tomorrow).</li>
  <li>Invite friends and folks I’ve played DnD with over the years.</li>
  <li>Develop the next region. Currently working on the Warm Sea, but who knows where I’ll end up – I jumped from the Sea to Bruna too, after all.</li>
  <li>Keep learning to draw.</li>
  <li>And, of course, work isn’t going anywhere (plus the DnD campaign I’m running – I haven’t forgotten about you guys, I promise!).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s about it. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got the website in order, drew concepts for all major non-human races and a couple of characters, created the alpha version of the Bruna region and the Wonders section.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Diaries, Issue 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Diaries, Issue 2" /><published>2025-03-04T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2025-03-04T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-2/"><![CDATA[<p>Straight to the point—what got done this past week:</p>

<h2 id="finished-the-map-of-malkona">Finished the Map of Malkona</h2>

<p>Or rather, I finalized its overall visual. Over the past few weeks, I’ve mostly been working on post-processing after exporting from Inkarnate: removing artifacts, refining rivers, lakes, and coastlines, tweaking color correction, and so on. Done! I’m satisfied. There’s still a long road ahead for adding all the necessary labels to the map—along with designing the typography (<em>turns out making it both readable and aesthetically pleasing is no easy task</em>)—but overall, the map is ready for its alpha release.</p>

<h2 id="started-learning-to-draw">Started Learning to Draw</h2>

<p>Honestly, anything remotely resembling “fine arts” has always been a sore spot for me: I sing terribly, dance atrociously, and drawing… yeah, let’s not even talk about that. The wobbly little house I drew in a career aptitude test was the pinnacle of my artistic career.</p>

<p>Time to learn. My thought process went like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developing a fictional world without visuals is not cool. I can see it in my head, but no one else can.</li>
  <li>Using AI-generated art for a public project? No thanks. Not my path.</li>
  <li>Commissioning artists? No money for that (<em>and they also can’t see inside my head</em>).</li>
</ol>

<p>So yeah, if you want art—grab a stylus and get to work.</p>

<p>I approached this systematically: took a Udemy course, armed myself with a tablet, a stylus, and an anatomy atlas (<em>a little something for casual evening reading</em>), and wished myself good luck.</p>

<p>The results of my first week can be seen on the <a href="/denizens/races/bryleahns" target="_self">Bryleahn</a> page. Initially, I just wanted to draw an ear—to celebrate reaching the “Ear Shapes” lesson—but then I got a little carried away. This is a Bryleahn girl. More than that, she’s a very specific Bryleahn girl who holds an important place in my heart—and in the planned Taliskarn story.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a very early concept—and there are issues I can see but don’t yet fully understand (<em>and I want to change her nose too</em>)—but I’m still really happy with it. I managed to transfer the overall idea from my head to the page without catastrophic losses!</p>

<p>I’m still figuring out where to post all these drawings—including those unrelated to Taliskarn but reflecting my progress. I want a record of the process. Might start an Instagram.</p>

<h2 id="finished-the-websites-technical-setup">Finished the Website’s Technical Setup</h2>

<p>Continued from last week:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finalized the templates for the main pages</li>
  <li>Implemented search and bilingual support (English-Russian)</li>
  <li>Set up a navigation system that works for me</li>
  <li>Did some minor work on responsiveness (<em>looks fine on my devices</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Next steps: integrate a module for displaying the map, consider blog comments (<em>most likely won’t have them—you can always find me on Discord, and the website is meant to be a static Taliskarn wiki-repo</em>), upload the base content, and get it online.</p>

<h2 id="wrote-the-first-taliskarn-short-story">Wrote the First Taliskarn Short Story</h2>

<p>Well, aside from the Myth—so if you count that, this would be the second. I’m publishing this <a href="/extras/stories/khurh_zan_ul" target="_self">story</a>, though I’m not entirely satisfied with the pacing in the final third. In any case, it’s still more of an experimental piece—testing out the style and principles of future storytelling. Along the way, I also expanded the wiki with more information on <a href="/denizens/races/arydars/" target="_self">Arydar</a> culture.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-coming-week">Plans for the Coming Week</h2>

<p>I want to push the website to publication as soon as possible—it’s an important milestone for me. So all available resources are being allocated to that. The tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finalize the base content: fill out the core pages</li>
  <li>Organize articles into proper sections based on what I already have solid ideas and materials for—most likely covering the major races and cultures, key central regions (Brylea-Verda-Riku), and some additional bits</li>
  <li>Add the necessary labels and icons to the map for the alpha version release</li>
  <li>Plan the structure for Discord and other external project resources</li>
  <li>Draw, draw, draw. Too tired to think? Time to draw.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Full workflow breakdown: if I haven’t cleared my main work tasks, I work on those. If I have, I think about Taliskarn. Too tired to think? I draw. Occasionally, eating and sleeping is a good idea too. Oh, and I have an ongoing DnD campaign that also demands time and energy. That’s life.</em></p>

<p>So, by the end of this week—or next at the latest—I hope to launch the project into its second phase: public development.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second issue of the Taliskarn journal: finished the map, started learning to draw, and unexpectedly wrote my first Taliskarn short story (but not publishing it yet)]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dev Diaries, Issue 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dev Diaries, Issue 1" /><published>2025-02-25T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/extras/blog/dd-1/"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, traveler—whoever you are and whatever brought you here—and welcome to the very first issue of the Taliskarn dev diaries!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-and-why-is-it-here">What is this, and why is it here?</h2>
<p>There are three main ideas behind this series:<br />
1) It serves as a chronicle of the project’s development. When I’m old and gray, I’ll look back at this and think, “Wow, you really had nothing better to do!”<br />
2) It strengthens the connection between me, the creator of Taliskarn, and its devoted community. Admittedly, for now, this community consists entirely of my own adventurers—who are stuck playing in my games and have nowhere to escape, MU-HA-HA—but hey, someday there will be more of us!<br />
3) It helps me structure my thoughts and keep pushing forward—better, stronger, and further.</p>

<p>So, in short, this is a personal developer’s diary of a fictional world: what’s been done over the past week, plans for the next, my thoughts on it all, and where Taliskarn is heading. Welcome to my stream of consciousness!</p>

<h2 id="progress-so-far">Progress So Far</h2>
<p>I started working on the Taliskarn website and preparing the setting for its alpha-release publication.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m still unsure whether I should be doing this. The reason is that there’s a lot of content planned for Taliskarn, and at the heart of it all is a novel (or rather, a whole series of novels). You can read more about this on the “<a href="/about" target="_self">About the Project</a>” page (<em>which I’m writing right now, by the way</em>), but here’s the main idea in short:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to write books set in Taliskarn.</li>
  <li>That takes time.</li>
  <li>I don’t intend to publish anything until at least the first—if not the second—book is fully completed.</li>
  <li>During the writing process, the world is bound to change significantly—potentially leading to full retcons of certain elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>So everything I’m working on and posting here right now is a draft version. When will it be finished? “Three minutes, Turkish!” So here’s the question: why even bother with a website at this stage?</p>

<p>I found enough reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It’s better to store everything where it will eventually belong—it helps me visualize the final structure.</li>
  <li>It’ll be easier to gather feedback.</li>
  <li>Maybe someone will find the project interesting even during its development. If not, at least I’ll have a record of the process.</li>
  <li>It keeps me disciplined.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I’m working on the website. At the same time, I’m finishing up map retouching and making the final adjustments before starting work on labeling.</p>]]></content><author><name>Orthan Thundy</name></author><category term="dev diaries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first issue of the Taliskarn journal: started building the website, wrote the world's myth, and planned the project's development strategy]]></summary></entry></feed>
