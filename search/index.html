        "author": "Orthan Thundy",
        "category": "",
        "content": "So, it’s March 12, 2025. I’m finishing these lines, uploading the site to GitHub Pages, waiting for the domain to connect, and Taliskarn is finally taking its place on the internet.  On one hand, it feels a bit early—worldbuilding alone rarely interests people, let alone a rough draft of a world. Even if we assume that the setting is shaping up well, as a reader, I’d still want to see stories and novels set in Taliskarn, and as a player or DM, I’d want adventures and content I can use right away to create my character or campaign. Right now, there’s neither.Even by my most optimistic plans, it’ll be a few more months before the first finished content from Taliskarn appears online—most likely a novel. And as for fully developed DnD adventures and a guidebook, I wouldn’t expect them before early fall, or even next winter. So, is anything actually finished? Not quite ^_^. But there are a few pages that are more developed than others, and I’d really appreciate feedback on them. The “Scarred Lands” Region Scarred Lands of Bruna At this stage of development, I want all regional and cultural pages to reach a similar level of completeness. A page should provide an overview of what this region is, its core concept, its wonders and points of interest, and who lives there. Broad strokes, but clear and understandable. Key questions for me:  Is the page readable? What could be improved? Is the region’s concept clear? Would you personally be interested in playing in this setting? What would you like to change/add/remove?Any other thoughts, ideas, or comments are also welcome! The Bryleahns BryleahnsThis page will still be expanded and refined, but overall, the major traits of the Bryleahn people are in place. The same questions apply as with Bruna. Malkona Map MapAny feedback on the map—are the regions readable, how does it feel overall, etc.? I probably won’t be making major changes like “let’s throw in a massive desert here,” but I can and will tweak things on a smaller scale. Wonders WondersThe concept of wonders in Taliskarn. Does it come across well? Is everything clear? Any ideas on how to implement and integrate this into DnD? Myth MythThis one is for the bravest souls. It covers the fundamental history of Taliskarn—how it was created, how its peoples came to be, and how we ended up where we are now. It might be a bit heavy to read due to its style, but that’s intentional. Again, I’d be grateful for any comments or suggestions—where things seem illogical, what could be added, what’s missing, etc. For any feedback on these pages—or any others, or really anything related to Taliskarn—I’d be super grateful! Oh, and one more thing… All Names &amp; Overall English Sound My native language is Russian, and I write in it first. While I do my best to make the English version sound and look great, as a non-native speaker, I lack what people call a “feel for the language.” Sometimes I just can’t tell whether something sounds good or awkward. That’s why I’d be especially grateful to native English speakers for any comments on where things feel off, what sounds outright bad, etc. Why launch the website now, when there’s not much to show yet? A few reasons:  To better exploit my alpha readers, MUHAHAHA. I share most of what I create with my players and friends—these are people who give me valuable feedback, and I deeply appreciate it. Over the next few months, I’ll occasionally ask others to check out the project—people I’ve played with before, friends, the broader Reddit community, etc. It’s convenient to do that by just sharing a link to the site. The site itself, along with the structured workflow of developing and updating the project, helps keep me disciplined and focused. Plus, it lets me see everything in a near-final format rather than just a blank Google Doc. The sooner, the better. Let the content pile up, let search engines start indexing things, and later, I’ll have a live record of how this idea evolved—so I can look back and tear up sentimentally. Who knows? Maybe someone will actually find the worldbuilding process itself interesting—drop by, comment, throw in ideas… That would be amazing 🙂So, from today, Taliskarn enters the phase of semi-public development. Join the Discord, follow project updates (some of you won’t have a choice :devil:), and thanks for being here! ",

        "content": "Over the past week: Website updates I cleaned up the Russian version of the website: removed completely empty pages, fixed most of the internationalization bugs, added table of contents and spoilers to articles, and updated page info to match the latest state of things. In short, the site is now ready for public launch. Drew non-human races Created concepts for Kyonnhs, Flammars, Noctids, plus as a bonus, a Prymar (sounds kinda weird, actually) and an Arydari. They’re all on their respective pages now, published and looking great (according to my mom, at least!). Prepared the “Scarred Lands” section You can check it out here. This is the level of detail I’m aiming for with all regions at this phase – and all peoples will get a similar treatment. I’m open to feedback and critique. Jotted down a bunch of notes on other regions Monsters, wonders, quirks, flavors, and so on. Some places are clear and well-defined in my mind, others are still a bit foggy – that’s just how it goes. Still learning to draw Finished the theory part of the “Character Drawing” course once, practiced drawing faces. Now I’ve gone back to the start of the course and structured my learning: I’m studying anatomy in parallel (hoping to get a basic grasp in 2-3 months), working on gestures (not making any predictions here), and dabbling with color (just for fun, in the evenings). And I’ll occasionally draw something for Taliskarn at my current level – sketch concepts, that sort of thing. But the focus remains on learning: I want to reach a decent skill level by mid-summer, when I plan to be close to publishing a novel or the first Taliskarn adventure. Started an Instagram. Will be posting art and progress there. Plans for the coming week  Prepare the English version of the site Publish the website (literally today or tomorrow). Invite friends and folks I’ve played DnD with over the years. Develop the next region. Currently working on the Warm Sea, but who knows where I’ll end up – I jumped from the Sea to Bruna too, after all. Keep learning to draw. And, of course, work isn’t going anywhere (plus the DnD campaign I’m running – I haven’t forgotten about you guys, I promise!).That’s about it. Stay tuned! ",

        "content": "Straight to the point—what got done this past week: Finished the Map of Malkona Or rather, I finalized its overall visual. Over the past few weeks, I’ve mostly been working on post-processing after exporting from Inkarnate: removing artifacts, refining rivers, lakes, and coastlines, tweaking color correction, and so on. Done! I’m satisfied. There’s still a long road ahead for adding all the necessary labels to the map—along with designing the typography (turns out making it both readable and aesthetically pleasing is no easy task)—but overall, the map is ready for its alpha release. Started Learning to Draw Honestly, anything remotely resembling “fine arts” has always been a sore spot for me: I sing terribly, dance atrociously, and drawing… yeah, let’s not even talk about that. The wobbly little house I drew in a career aptitude test was the pinnacle of my artistic career. Time to learn. My thought process went like this:  Developing a fictional world without visuals is not cool. I can see it in my head, but no one else can. Using AI-generated art for a public project? No thanks. Not my path. Commissioning artists? No money for that (and they also can’t see inside my head).So yeah, if you want art—grab a stylus and get to work. I approached this systematically: took a Udemy course, armed myself with a tablet, a stylus, and an anatomy atlas (a little something for casual evening reading), and wished myself good luck. The results of my first week can be seen on the Bryleahn page. Initially, I just wanted to draw an ear—to celebrate reaching the “Ear Shapes” lesson—but then I got a little carried away. This is a Bryleahn girl. More than that, she’s a very specific Bryleahn girl who holds an important place in my heart—and in the planned Taliskarn story. Of course, this is a very early concept—and there are issues I can see but don’t yet fully understand (and I want to change her nose too)—but I’m still really happy with it. I managed to transfer the overall idea from my head to the page without catastrophic losses! I’m still figuring out where to post all these drawings—including those unrelated to Taliskarn but reflecting my progress. I want a record of the process. Might start an Instagram. Finished the Website’s Technical Setup Continued from last week:  Finalized the templates for the main pages Implemented search and bilingual support (English-Russian) Set up a navigation system that works for me Did some minor work on responsiveness (looks fine on my devices)Next steps: integrate a module for displaying the map, consider blog comments (most likely won’t have them—you can always find me on Discord, and the website is meant to be a static Taliskarn wiki-repo), upload the base content, and get it online. Wrote the First Taliskarn Short Story Well, aside from the Myth—so if you count that, this would be the second. I’m publishing this story, though I’m not entirely satisfied with the pacing in the final third. In any case, it’s still more of an experimental piece—testing out the style and principles of future storytelling. Along the way, I also expanded the wiki with more information on Arydar culture. Plans for the Coming Week I want to push the website to publication as soon as possible—it’s an important milestone for me. So all available resources are being allocated to that. The tasks:  Finalize the base content: fill out the core pages Organize articles into proper sections based on what I already have solid ideas and materials for—most likely covering the major races and cultures, key central regions (Brylea-Verda-Riku), and some additional bits Add the necessary labels and icons to the map for the alpha version release Plan the structure for Discord and other external project resources Draw, draw, draw. Too tired to think? Time to draw.Full workflow breakdown: if I haven’t cleared my main work tasks, I work on those. If I have, I think about Taliskarn. Too tired to think? I draw. Occasionally, eating and sleeping is a good idea too. Oh, and I have an ongoing DnD campaign that also demands time and energy. That’s life. So, by the end of this week—or next at the latest—I hope to launch the project into its second phase: public development. Stay tuned! ",

        "content": "Greetings, traveler—whoever you are and whatever brought you here—and welcome to the very first issue of the Taliskarn dev diaries! What is this, and why is it here? There are three main ideas behind this series:1) It serves as a chronicle of the project’s development. When I’m old and gray, I’ll look back at this and think, “Wow, you really had nothing better to do!”2) It strengthens the connection between me, the creator of Taliskarn, and its devoted community. Admittedly, for now, this community consists entirely of my own adventurers—who are stuck playing in my games and have nowhere to escape, MU-HA-HA—but hey, someday there will be more of us!3) It helps me structure my thoughts and keep pushing forward—better, stronger, and further. So, in short, this is a personal developer’s diary of a fictional world: what’s been done over the past week, plans for the next, my thoughts on it all, and where Taliskarn is heading. Welcome to my stream of consciousness! Progress So Far I started working on the Taliskarn website and preparing the setting for its alpha-release publication. To be honest, I’m still unsure whether I should be doing this. The reason is that there’s a lot of content planned for Taliskarn, and at the heart of it all is a novel (or rather, a whole series of novels). You can read more about this on the “About the Project” page (which I’m writing right now, by the way), but here’s the main idea in short:  I want to write books set in Taliskarn. That takes time. I don’t intend to publish anything until at least the first—if not the second—book is fully completed. During the writing process, the world is bound to change significantly—potentially leading to full retcons of certain elements.So everything I’m working on and posting here right now is a draft version. When will it be finished? “Three minutes, Turkish!” So here’s the question: why even bother with a website at this stage? I found enough reasons:  It’s better to store everything where it will eventually belong—it helps me visualize the final structure. It’ll be easier to gather feedback. Maybe someone will find the project interesting even during its development. If not, at least I’ll have a record of the process. It keeps me disciplined.So, I’m working on the website. At the same time, I’m finishing up map retouching and making the final adjustments before starting work on labeling. ",

    "denizens-races-arydars": {
      "title": "Arydars",
      "content": "    Work in Progress In progress right now—this is just a rough draft, which may change significantly. However, the core vibe should remain: these are nomads with a distinct barbarian culture that emphasizes ancestor worship, strict traditions, body markings, and extensive craftsmanship with bones.In DnD terms, if we consider the typical inclinations of the people, Arydars make excellent material for barbarians, rangers, and sorcerers. Arydars—free nomads of Verda—are resilient, proud, and strong people, accustomed to life on the arid plains of Malkona. Born riders, they view the Ocean’s salty waters with distrust and a hint of fear. They avoid sea travel and prefer to stay away from the coast, remaining within the grassy seas. Most Arydars spend their entire lives roaming freely, migrating across the copper-hued plains, hunting, and herding livestock. Dark-skinned and narrow-eyed, they look at the world with unwavering determination and self-assurance. Arydars are lean, with high cheekbones and sharp facial features. They are natural riders, skilled hunters, and archers, possessing an intricate understanding of human and animal anatomy. Different Arydar tribes inhabit various parts of the Verda plains, but certain cultural traits are common among them all. Material Culture First and foremost, like other peoples of Verda, Arydars have no free access to metals and possess little knowledge of metalworking. Their primary materials are specially treated bones and animal hides. For example, their long knives, spearheads, and other tools are crafted from the bones of tauroks and talard-antelopes. The bones are cleaned, shaped, soaked in oil extracted from the roots of the talgaris shrub, coated in a mixture of animal fat and ash, and then hardened over several hours of heat treatment. The primary weapon of any Arydar—the bow—is made from the resilient horns of talards, with glue boiled from their cartilage and talgaris resin. Traditional nomadic armor consists of hide-based protection, while their shields are woven from talgaris branches, reinforced with multiple layers of talard leather. Arydars live in warm yurts, their frames made from horns and ribs, covered externally with leather, felt, and hides. A totem animal’s skull is often placed atop the yurt, and it is customary to replace it every one or two years; otherwise, the restless spirit of the beast may grow angry and wrathful instead of offering protection. Customs and Beliefs NSFW: Warning—some customs and traditions of the Arydars may seem shocking. Read at your own risk. The foundation of Arydar society is the cult of ancestor worship and their achievements. During their lifetime, every Arydar immortalizes their accomplishments on their own skin (the method of marking depends on the tribe). This is a sacred ritual that requires the blessing of the eldest family member, and in some cases, even the council of elders. After death, the Arydars respectfully cut out sections of skin displaying the most significant achievements and preserve them through a special treatment process. The resulting piece is sewn onto the clan’s ancestral banner, forever tying the deceased’s deeds to the glorious history of their lineage. Additionally, separately treated strips of skin, taken from honored enemies, are attached to the same banners. Arydars place no less importance on the bones of their ancestors. The nomads believe that a person’s or animal’s spirit remains in its skull after death, only leaving once it is properly buried—though a fraction of their strength lingers in other bones as well. One of the most striking expressions of this belief is the “ancestral chain”—a series of vertebrae from forebears, strung together on a talard’s sinew. Such a guardian chain is worn as a bracelet or belt, depending on its length. Other customs exist as well. For example, the Tondrantar tribe of the Coppergrass region takes the finger phalanges of fallen enemies. These bones are fashioned into wind chimes and attached to their bodies and talards—when they move, the bones clatter and whistle, and the Tondrantars say that the voices of the defeated sing their praises. As for skulls—whether human or beast—they must always be buried. If not, the spirit remains tethered to the earth. A burned skull signifies the final death of the spirit—an ultimate sacrilege and an insult to all traditions. ",

However, the core vibe should remain: these are “dark-skinned Spartans” who value human potential and self-improvement above all else.In DnD terms, if we consider the typical inclinations of the people, Brunars make excellent fighters, monks, and wizards. Brunars—people who live under the crimson sun of the lands of Bruna—are a nation of hardened warriors. Dark-skinned and golden-eyed, tall and strong, they have spent generations surviving in a hostile climate surrounded by hostile peoples. This has taught them to rely not on gods, but on themselves and their own strength. Brunars follow the “Path of Trials,” exalting physical power and mental fortitude above all else. They are resilient and proud warriors who build impregnable fortresses in the heart of the desert. They rarely show aggression toward their neighbors but will allow no one to step onto their land without permission. Brunars wear their earned scars with pride but reject any intentional harm to their own bodies—tattoo culture is considered filthy and savage among them. Few can rival the Brunars in mastery of melee weapons or endurance in extreme heat. They have a tendency to accumulate knowledge and wealth, valuing the worth of every object. ",

      "content": "“The east of Malkona, the shimmering land of Bryleah on the banks of the sacred Sanguama River—the cradle of all life on the continent… or at least, that’s what the wetskins believe. The kingdom of untamed nature here certainly boasts unparalleled diversity: the crimson backwaters of the Scar bear little resemblance to the rotting mangroves of the Fetid Fens, just as the heavy silence beneath the colossal trees of northern Sanguama starkly contrasts with the constant cacophony filling the brighter, lower thickets of the sacred river’s delta. In those rare places where sunlight manages to pierce through the lush canopy, thousands of golden reflections begin their dance among the undergrowth. The reason for this is lacrikael, the ‘Tears of Kaelesta—a thick, transparent resin generously secreted by the local trees. Viscous and dense, it refracts and scatters light as brilliantly as the northern diamonds, shimmering under the sun in every color of the rainbow. This is why the long-eared children of Fluére named their land ‘Bryleah,’ meaning ‘The Shimmering’. Yet, for all its breathtaking beauty, this land is not only a place of wonders but also of dangers. Creeping vines coil around the ankles of travelers, crystal flies never miss a chance to drink their blood, and lurking in the branches of any tree might be a moss-hide beast—the ruthless predator ruling the Bryleahn jungles. And I won’t even start on the unbearable humidity. Enjoy.” Here and beyond, I present excerpts from the epoch-defining work, “Notes on Taliskarn, Its Wonders, and the Creatures That Inhabit This World.”  Core Themes and Ideas of Bryleah    Dense jungles, yet every ray of light blooms into sparks in the droplets of lacrikael—’the shimmering lands.’  Poisons, predators, diseases, and elusive hunters.  Amphibian-like Bryleahns, weaving their cities among the massive branches and vines of ancient trees.  A highly developed culture in terms of knowledge and nature—Bryleahns are philosophers and alchemists.  A touch of Mesoamerican motifs.

      "content": "              Lifespan:      60-70 years (subject to change)              Height:      4-6.5 feet, older = taller              Homeland:      Bryleah              Progenitor:      Fluère       Bryleahns are a people born from the blood of Fluère, Mother of All Currents, who have spread along the shores of the sacred river Sanguama.   Table of Content     Quick Overview (open if you don't want to read the entire page)Bryleahns – cold-blooded jungle dwellers:Appearance: finned ears, yellow-green skin, height from 4 to 6.5 feet (older = taller), no hair, a crest on the head, large eyes, broad shoulders, voluminous ribcages, no breasts in women;Lifespan: on average, 60-70 years;Common occupations: hunters, alchemists, scholars, and philosophers;Philosophy: \"Follow the current without changing it\";Race themes: harmony with nature, warmth and water, poisons;Weapons: tridents, blowpipes;Cities: traditionalists \"weave\" their homes on giant trees, reformists build in human fashion but on elevated ground;Similar races from other worlds: merfolk from MtG, tritons from… well, anywhere you like :)DnD Classes: stereotypical Bryleahns are well-suited for rangers, druids, alchemists, and wizards (note: magic is rare in Taliskarn, but if you want to, who's stopping you?).Appearance and Physiology Bryleahns are lean and sinewy humanoids, perfectly adapted to life in the dense and humid jungles of Bryleah. In youth, they are short: by the time they reach adulthood at their tenth spring, they barely stand 4-4.5 feet tall. However, they never stop growing, and in old age, a Bryleahn may reach 6-6.5 feet. Their faces resemble those of humans, but their large eyes are covered by a transparent third eyelid, their cheeks are sunken, and their small mouths are filled with sharp, needle-like teeth. Bryleahns have large, hairless heads with prominent fin-like ears and a short crest that begins at the middle of their high foreheads and runs to the back of their skulls. Their blood is cold and azure, like the waters of Sanguama, which is why their ears and crests are riddled with blood vessels—this helps them regulate their body temperature. Their skin is thick, covered in small bumps, and has a pale yellow tint. Bryleahns have broad, powerful shoulders, long arms and fingers, with small webbing between the first phalanges. Their spines protrude slightly above the skin, forming a subtle ridge, while their agile, elongated legs resemble something between those of a monkey and a frog. Bryleahns are carnivores, eating meat and fish while using plants only as seasonings; they are entirely intolerant of milk. Bryleahn children are fed meat from birth, which is why Bryleahn women have no breasts or nipples. However, like all children of Fluère, they possess expanded, pronounced ribcages, allowing them to hold their breath for 15-20 minutes with ease. Culture The nature and temperament of Bryleahns resemble the currents spawned by Fluère: the young are like swift, meandering streams, twisting through the undergrowth and tumbling over small waterfalls, while the wise elders become like a slow, broad river that does not waver before any obstacle. The vast majority of Bryleahns follow the Cult of Currents:  “Life is like the current of the great river Sanguama: it has a beginning and an end. By weaving the streams of our fate with the currents of other living beings, we flow through this river from its source to its mouth, where we will finally merge with the waters of the Mother.” They naturally seek not to change the world but to live in harmony with it, preserving its primal nature. They are a people of philosophers and scholars, understanding the natural order through observation and contemplation. Note: Of course, not all interpret the tenets of the Cult of Currents the same way. For example, Bryleahns living in the northern swamps of the Scar refuse to wear clothing or use tools, whereas the inhabitants of Azure Haven in the south have no qualms about cutting down trees for their homes and firing clay. Nonetheless, a general desire to maintain natural harmony is a trait common to all Bryleahns. Material Culture All Bryleahns are natural-born hunters. They move like silent shadows through the thick undergrowth along the banks of Sanguama, diving into its azure waters without a single ripple to ambush their prey. As weapons, Bryleahns use reed blowpipes that fire toxic thorns with incredible force and barbed tridents—long-hafted spears with gleaming tips cast from lacrikael resin. The same resin, specially treated and reinforced, is used to craft their tools: knives and needles, fishing hooks, utensils, and more. Hunters also frequently employ sticky nets woven from jungle vines. Bryleahns wear minimal clothing, covering only their loins, but they adorn themselves with amulets cast from lakrikael, bracelets woven from bark and vines, and wide braided belts with pouches and vials. Southern Bryleahns of Azure Haven, where gold is more abundant, also incorporate golden bracelets and ornaments into their attire. The Hunting Mask               Image of the mask          The most prized possession of any adult Bryleahn is their hunting mask. The people of Bryleah know that the Terror of the Forests, Moss-hide, is too cautious to attack prey face-to-face, so they had to give themselves eyes on the back of their heads. The mask is usually made from animal hides stretched over a frame of reinforced lakrikael vines, ritually painted, and adorned with two glowing azure gemstone eyes—fragments of lapis lazuli brought down from the headwaters of Sanguama. They are worn on the back of the head, and no Bryleahn in their right mind would leave a settlement without their mask. Bryleahns are master alchemists, deeply skilled in herbal medicine and well-versed in the art of poisons. Traditionally, Bryleahns build their settlements on tree trunks, skillfully weaving vines and branches together without harming the trees themselves. Meza, the Woven City, rising from an island in the middle of Sanguama, is one of the true wonders of Malkona—a sanctuary for philosophers, scholars, and poets. Southern Bryleahns, whose lands lack trees large enough for woven dwellings, build their homes atop high riverbank hills, constructing them almost in human fashion, from wood, straw, and clay. ",

Why not just use WORLD NAME? In short—because I want to. In a bit more detail: I love the process of creating this world—first and foremost. I run a lot of DnD and other TTRPG adventures, and I want to do it in a world that fully, 100% aligns with my personal expectations and goals—second. And third—I just enjoy trying to make something awesome that will appeal not only to me and my players but to others as well. And here we are. Nothing is finished yet, so why is it here? To save myself from doing it twice: it’s convenient for me to upload content to the platform where it will eventually end up. Plus, it helps with indexing. Plus, it makes requesting feedback easier. Plus, it keeps me disciplined. In short, this is an “open-to-visitors construction site.” Is there anything actually finished? Not fully finished, but at the “ready for discussion” stage—so I’d really appreciate feedback and ideas. Current questions list. WHEN will something be finished? No idea—when it’s done, it’s done. Ideally, something finished—whether to read or to play—will be ready around mid-to-late summer. And the second thing (depending on the order of work) will be done by late fall or early winter. But we’ll see—what matters most is to finish it, and to finish it well. Why Two Taliskarns? For the planned novels, I need the world in one state; for DnD adventures without excessive homebrew tweaking—I need it in another. Of course, the “Dark Time” version can be run in Fate—and I absolutely plan to do that—but… I love DnD. :) Besides, these two versions of Taliskarn don’t conflict, but there’s a 100–150 year gap between them, so I need the world in both timeframes. Ideally, the second one will emerge naturally after I finish the core series of novels. More than that—I’m certain that in the long run, there will be a third one: Taliskarn in the age of industrialization (something akin to “The Legend of Korra” in spirit). This is too big for one person; you’ll burn out and quit I’ve been simmering with this idea for 10 years, and it hasn’t let me go. As of March 2025, I’ve been actively working on it for nearly six months. So far, so good. I believe in myself. Plus, I’m not alone—you’re reading these lines right now, aren’t you? :) How can I help the project? Nothing easier:  Give me feedback on my ideas Suggest your own (I can’t promise they’ll be accepted, but a fresh perspective often brings exactly what was missing) Report bugs on the website, map, or anything else Draw something for Taliskarn Share it with people who might be interested Simply join our small communityIs the project dead?

    "wonders": {
      "title": "Wonders",
      "content": "There is no magic in Taliskarn… but it is full of wonders. I love that word—”wonders”—it carries a sense of mystery, amazement, and the unknown, everything I believe Taliskarn should be. You can encounter magic at every turn, but a “wonder” is always something truly exceptional and unforgettable. That is the core idea I personally adhere to. Wonders of the World The sky lord lazily drifting over the great steppes, the soaring whale Tensur. The shadow-boar dissolving into twilight mist. The bright azure waters of the Spring of Origin, rumored to heal even the most grievous wounds. The ghosts of long-forgotten battles roaming the Weeping Savannas. The eerie Neblings lurking in the toxic haze of the Fetid Fens. The world of Taliskarn is full of wonders, and many myths and legends hold truth—but whether encountering them will be a blessing or a curse… who can say?  Margin ScribbleFor me, as a TTRPG player, my favorite moment is encountering something new. I don’t like spoilers or “dungeon-clearing” with constant glances at the bestiary—I love when the GM surprises me. I adore challenges I haven’t faced before, creatures I’ve never heard of, and riddles I haven’t solved. Accordingly, as a GM, I gravitate toward the same kind of gameplay: creating a constant sense of discovery for my players, making them pioneers of an unexplored world. Let them know the rules and concepts, but the details… Leave those to the GM—if they want, they’ll share them after the session. So, in my campaigns, the rule is simple: if wonders serve this idea, there can never be too many of them. The world must amaze—or rather, I want it to. You will encounter the wonders of this world at every turn: in the descriptions of regions and cultures, peoples and customs, the history of the world, and plans for the future. These will be astonishing places and creatures beyond imagination, fantastical materials, and manifestations of divine will—or even divine caprice. However, I strive to keep everything within reason: neither in Dark Age Taliskarn (~450-550 AR) nor in New Dawn Taliskarn (~600 AR and beyond) is there a place for gods roaming Malkona, dragons scorching entire lands with their breath, or other overwhelmingly powerful entities. At least not in my version—if you want them, who’s stopping you? ;) Wonders of Mortals A steppe hunter raises his bow, whispers a brief prayer to his ancestors, and his arrow flies true. A healer mixes the sap of medicinal plants with the ashes of a fire directly on an open wound, murmuring quiet pleas to forest spirits, and the pain fades. A Bryleahn, cornered by a moss-hided beast, suddenly hurls a thin-walled vial at its snarling face, and flames engulf the creature. The Wonders of Mortals are rare and perilous attempts by the people of Taliskarn to imitate the deeds of the gods. This is not magic in its conventional sense, but rather alchemy, technology, rituals, and pacts with spirits—all of which come at a price. Even though the Age of Wonders has long passed and the Forebears no longer bestow their gifts so freely, echoes of those times still stir the blood of Malkona’s inhabitants. Just ask, and you’ll hear a dozen incredible tales of miracle-workers: mighty warriors who single-handedly routed dozens of foes, cunning shamans who could even bring back the dead, stormcallers who summoned the wrath of Kustopha upon their enemies… There are many stories—but how much truth do they hold? That’s for you to decide.  My answer: not much. I see Taliskarn as a mysterious, wild, and dangerous world—a frontier, harsh and unwelcoming. I want my players to feel less like mighty heroes solving the problems of entire continents and more like ordinary adventurers, explorers, and fortune-seekers. Every battle is a serious challenge, every mistake has its cost and consequences. In my vision, the wonders accessible to mortals should exist—but in strictly limited form. Not “a magic shop in every village,” but “a few ancient scrolls containing divine secrets, kept by a great scholar in Mesa.” Not “twenty healing potions and a feather for change,” but “I heard there’s a healer in a Saultuar village near the Steppes who knows the secrets of herbal brews.” Not “I snap my fingers, and a fireball flies forth,” but “I spend a rare and costly component that I struggled to obtain.” Not “a goddess personally explained it to me,” but “a spirit of the world gave me a cryptic hint.” The same applies to warriors: not “I single-handedly kill five enemies per round,” but “there are three of them, the odds are against me—I need to retreat.” My Taliskarn is a world poor in supernatural abilities, where one must struggle and face the consequences of bad decisions. That’s why for my campaigns set in the Dark Age of Taliskarn, I plan to use Fate Core—and if my D&amp;D-loving players insist on their usual system, they’ll have to accept a world that, by Faerûn’s standards, is utterly impoverished. And yes, the greater the wonder, the higher the price. In every sense (for example, Flumorn could grant access to resurrection—but would you dare to use it?). At the same time, Taliskarn itself offers everything needed for magic—or rather, the wonders of mortals—to flourish. We have gods, ancient secrets, extraordinary ingredients, mystical regions, and legendary events. Want a classic D&amp;D 5e adventure? We’ve got them! This is especially true for the New Dawn Taliskarn (once it’s released—see the corresponding page for details). In Progress With the release of New Dawn Taliskarn—or sooner, if I decide to launch a D&amp;D campaign for Taliskarn—I plan to compile a spell list for Taliskarn, covering 1st-3rd level D&amp;D spells with lore, context, ingredients, and more. Timing is uncertain, as I need to finish the Dark Age first. But if you have any ideas or drafts, please share them. ",

      "title": "About",
      "content": "About Taliskarn is a fictional world-building project currently in active development. According to my grand plans, Taliskarn is set to receive the following content:  A fully developed setting with its own wiki, map, regional guides, bestiaries, and adventures. A series of novels set in Taliskarn (which, to be honest, was the original goal—until I got a little too invested in world-building and decided to merge my two creative hobbies). The stories will unfold during The Dark Time and lead up to the point where The New Dawn begins—by which time the world should be well-suited for both Fate-style games and more traditional D&amp;D adventures. Adventures, additional materials, and more.We’ll see how it all turns out. About the Author       My name is Dmitrii Sosnin. My players know me better as Fortan or Thunda (it’s more like “Tkhunda”, but who cares), but I like using different versions of my pseudonyms for different creative projects. That’s why I sign Taliskarn as Orthan Thundy. A guy, 32 years old (as of March 2025), who has been passionate about fantasy since childhood—devouring books, playing games, and then writing short stories, getting into MtG, discovering D&amp;D… and, well, rolling down the slippery slope :). In TTRPGs, I quickly realized that my place wasn’t so much at the table as behind the GM screen—I absolutely love creating worlds, stories, and characters, then watching my ideas come to life in my players’ eyes as they weave their own narratives in my setting. This project is my attempt at a magnum opus in this genre, my way of expressing accumulated ideas and putting nearly 20 years of experience to work. I’m here to write an ode to my love for fantasy, TTRPGs, and D&amp;D in particular. I’m trying to create Taliskarn. Join me—as an audience, a consultant, a critic, or an active participant! Project Development Chronicle A record of milestones and plans that have become reality. The Distant Past  Conceived the general idea | Around 2015, though I don’t remember exactly Spent 10 years thinking, “No way, I can’t pull this off…” While running campaigns, writing stories, gaining experience, and building up the courage.2024  Began active development | September 2024 Defined the overall concept: what the world is, why it exists, what happens in it, and who lives there | September 2024 Outlined the key features of each region | September 2024 Started drawing the physical map of Malkona—the main continent of Taliskarn | September 14, 2024 Wrote the foundational mythology and history of the world… | September 27, 2024 …and in the process, sketched out notes on its peoples, their cultures, and physiological traits | October 2024Winter 2025  Finish drawing the first version of the physical map of Malkona, hand it over for retouching. Completely exhausted. | February 16, 2025 Retouch the map: refine coastlines, gradients, colors, apply post-processing, and tweak a couple of regions in the process. | February 16-27, 2025 Write the narrative version of the Myth of Taliskarn in alpha (covering the main gods and events—will likely need expansion and revisions later, but this is the starting point). | February 18, 2025 Realize that Taliskarn needs artwork—a map alone won’t cut it. Estimate the budget. Feel sad. Commission the first sketch from an artist. | February 24, 2025 Receive the sketch—it’s cool, but not quite what I envisioned. Matches the budget I had, I’d say. Feel even sadder. Realize that no one will read my mind on my budget. Make the tough decision to start learning to draw (never had a knack for fine arts). | February 25, 2025 Grind through a character drawing course like a madman, learn Procreate. Simultaneously do another pass on the regions, placing major—region-defining—points of interest and large labels on the map. | February 26-28, 2025 A sudden burst of inspiration—I write the first short story vignette for Taliskarn. Chronologically, it’s either a prologue or an extra-flashback to the main story I have in mind. Walk around feeling satisfied—the first step is taken. | February 28, 2025Spring 2025  Launch the website, fill its pages with basic information, write my own comments. | March 1-12, 2025 Unexpectedly draw my first Taliskarn sketch: Ismeria, a Bryleahn and the main character of the first planned novels. Spend half a day on it—still not happy with the brow ridges (or rather, the folds under them), and it’s an early concept… but overall, I’m crying with joy. | March 4, 2025 Get completely absorbed in drawing. Nothing turns out right. Occasionally ask my mother (who is very good at drawing) for help—she points out obvious mistakes and explains how to fix them. Struggle through the concepts of Noctids, Kyonnhs, and Flammars—the main non-human races of Taliskarn. Overall, I’m happy. | March 5, 2025 Keep drawing. Create portraits of a few more key characters. Slowly start to relax: shift drawing practice to 2-3 hours a day, focusing on improvement rather than immediate content production (realizing that the few tricks I’ve learned won’t be enough). Skeleton anatomy, here I come… Refocus on pushing the project toward public development. | March 6, 2025 Set up a Discord server for the project, possibly other social media platforms. | March 12, 2025 Move the project to limited public development: publish the website, invite my players, friends, and acquaintances as the initial audience. | March 12, 2025 Panic a little. Move the project to full public development: present some content and seek feedback from major communities on Reddit, for example. | March 12, 2025 —&gt;WE ARE HERE: Panicking a lot. | March 12, 2025Future Plans Here’s what I still plan to do and in what order.Note: All dates below are my hopes and goals, not fixed deadlines. Spring-Summer 2025  Gather feedback, possibly make some immediate adjustments. Detailing region by region: geography, wonders, population and its culture, cities and settlements, points of interest, bestiary. For now, everything remains in the “general information, current concept” stage. As I finalize details, I publish them on the site, seek feedback, and make edits, notes, and adjustments. Looking at Malcona in its entirety, ensuring harmony and consistency within the world, making necessary revisions to the regions. Adding essential reference materials: articles on economy, lore clarifications, etc. A glossary? Establishing the world’s status as an alpha version, starting to write novels. In the process, I further develop and adapt the world, refining it in greater depth, and reflecting changes in the wiki.Fall 2025  Bringing the storyline in the novels (or at least their finalized synopsis) to the stage of “Taliskarn: The New Dawn.” Taking a breather. Beginning work on the first fully-fledged supplement for Taliskarn – “Notes on the Warm Sea” (probably). Developing all necessary elements: geography, population, cities, NPCs, bestiary with stat blocks, DM tables, and several adventures in the region. Most likely preparing corresponding Foundry modules. Sincerely hoping that by this point, I’ll have learned to draw well enough to illustrate it with something better than awful sketches.Winter 2026  With the completion of the supplement, announcing Taliskarn’s transition to beta version. Celebrating. Distributing the supplement as widely as possible (for free), trying to attract the community and DMs to it, gathering feedback, revising and polishing it. Starting work on the next supplement, trying to secure funding and support for professional design, publishing, etc. Happily continuing to work on Taliskarn, trying to breathe as much life into this world as I possibly can.Project Support Right now, I’m mostly working on Taliskarn alone, relying on my love for this project, patience, diligence, and other positive words. Given that my current budget consists of two cups of coffee and a sandwich, I can’t afford to hire anyone at the moment, but if you’re interested in what I’m doing, I’d be grateful for any kind of participation:  A kind piece of advice Brutal critique Feedback and comments A question about Taliskarn A powerful idea Bug reports on the website Bug reports on the map A shared link to any of the project’s resources A drawing Simply being around in some way (as a creator, it means a lot to know that my work has caught someone’s interest)So, if for some reason you’ve read this far and feel drawn to the project – or if you just have something to say to the author – all links to our resources and my contact details are below. I’d deeply appreciate any advice, feedback, or recommendations. Thank you.

    "malkona-verda": {
      "title": "Verdant Verdas",
      "content": "“The Great Verdah Plains: nearly two thousand miles of magnificent monotony—no matter where you look, it’s all just grass. Sparse forests in the river valleys (of which there are only a couple) feel like a celebration, and spotting a mesa on the horizon nearly made me jump for joy—finally, a change in scenery! Still, credit must be given to the locals: they don’t let you get bored. Over the course of several months traveling through Verdah, I was nearly flayed alive eight times, attacked twice by a steppe griffon, almost trampled by a herd of wild talards, and as for how many times I had to fight off steppe jackals and other curious creatures—I lost count. As you might have guessed, I am not a fan of arid steppes. But if you happen to enjoy the scent of talard sweat, the whistle of the wind, endless horizons, and cities (or rather, encampments) of barbarians, you’ll love it. P.S. Varmego is overrated: dirty, noisy—aside from the Shield district, there’s nothing worth seeing. P.S.S. I never did see the flying whale, Tensur. Quite disappointing.” Here and throughout, I present excerpts from the epochal work “Notes on Taliskarn, Its Wonders, and the Creatures That Inhabit This World.” In the heart of the continent of Malkona, the vast Verdah Plains stretch from the Scarred Lands of Bruna in the west nearly to the shores of the Warm Sea in the east. Water is scarce, forests grow only along major rivers and lakes, and more often than not, from horizon to horizon, all one sees is a rolling sea of grass, endlessly swayed by ceaseless winds. However, the closer one gets to the northern foothills, the more frequently mesas—”the teeth of the earth,” which have withstood the mighty breath of Kaelesta—rise from the steppe.  Work in ProgressThis page is a work in progress. Most likely, as content is refined and expanded, it will be divided into three separate sections: forests, plains, and coastline. These are vastly different regions in terms of atmosphere and themes, but for now, they are grouped together for ease of work. The Verdah Plains Across the copper-red plains migrate herds of giant bison—tauroks—and swift-footed antelope—talards. Blue-winged falcons circle the skies over Verdah, while steppe griffons nest atop the mesas, and near the rare lakes and watering holes, packs of grass jackals prowl, waiting for prey. Sometimes, in the distant heights, a flying whale, Tensur—the lingering symbol of the long-lost Age of Wonders—can be seen drifting lazily above the steppe. The proud Arydars call these vast lands their home.  Key Themes and Ideas of the Verdah Plains    The plains belong to nomadic tribes: barbarian lands, arid and open to the relentless winds.  Ancestor worship, brutal customs, extensive use of bones and tanned hides (including from sentient beings) for all manner of purposes.  Constant migration of all living things.  Large fauna: stone bulls, Mesa Griffons, etc.  Mysteries of nature: lost lands atop the mesas, deep caves beneath them, forgotten burial mounds scattered across the steppe.  Adventures centered on interacting with the barbarians, their culture and traditions, hunting, raiding caravans (everyone loves raiding caravans!). The Forests of Verda The forests of central Malkona—those in the northern foothills and along the banks of major rivers and lakes. These lands are home to the pale-skinned people of the Saltuars.  Core Themes and Ideas of the Forests of Verda    The forests are inhabited by the Saltuars—pale-skinned, secretive, and cautious people who worship spirits.  A druidic aesthetic blending Slavic and Shinto motifs.  A variety of spirits, ranging from playful and mischievous to dangerous, grim, and outright cruel.  Adventures align with this: searching for hidden settlements, discovering “places of power,” forging pacts with spirits, and unraveling the mysteries of nature’s wonders. The Coast of Verda The entire southern stretch, from the canyons of “Solkalor’s Trail” to the savannas of Bruna. These lands are fertile enough to support a sedentary life of fishermen and farmers. Most of the cities of the Prymars—the most culturally advanced of the human peoples—are also located here.  Core Themes and Ideas of the Coast of Verda    The heart of civilization in central Malkona: almost feudal, resembling a proper state. Warmego, in particular, is a respectable and rapidly developing city.  Seafaring and reverence for the Ocean.  Adventures from the plains and forests apply here as well, with an added layer of urban intrigue and a slightly more advanced level of culture.  Notes on the MarginThe Verda region still lacks detail for now. I really like the Saltuars and their spirit-filled forests—everything feels solid there. As for the plains, I love the envisioned aesthetic—I can clearly picture these vast steppes and feel their atmosphere—but I have yet to pinpoint a distinctive “hook” for adventures. It’s a work in progress. The same goes for the coast: beyond Warmego, which is well-developed, it currently feels too basic and lacking in uniqueness. Maybe that’s fine, but I’ll be thinking about this region a lot more. ",

An eternal haze swirls over the serene surface of white – colder than ice – waters of a lake lost in these forests. In the mist among the trees, every now and then, the ghost of a predatory shadow flickers, and the oppressive silence is broken only by the occasional distant howl of a wolf or a low, rumbling roar. Hundreds of miles to the south lie the endless russet steppes. From horizon to horizon, the eye beholds only a swaying sea of coppergrass, and occasionally, rare table mountains. Across this arid land, herds of stone bulls roam slowly in their eternal migration, while predatory birds circle lazily in the skies above – there’s no need to hurry here… until you hear the growing thunder of talards’ hoofbeats and the rapidly approaching whistle of bone amulets adorning the manes of their steeds. The glittering Bryleahn jungles: a warm realm of rampant nature – here, you never know from which tree a predatory moss-hide beast might leap, or from where a poisoned dart might fly. The scorching sun of the Scarred Lands of Bruna. Poisonous mists of the Fetid Fens. The mind-dulling twilight of Noctaria. The blazing wastelands of the Shards of Flammarg. All of this is Taliskarn: a harsh, unfriendly, inhospitable, and at times outright cruel world. A world created to challenge players and immerse them in an atmosphere of perpetual struggle: for resources, for territories, for life and freedom.

Its vast lands stretch nearly 5,000 miles from east to west and 3,000 miles from north to south, providing a home to diverse peoples and creatures.  Margin ScribbleMalkona – and Taliskarn as a whole – is designed to be the “ultimate sandbox” for me, my players, and anyone who finds my world worthy of their attention. There are many like it, but this one is mine, and it fully reflects the theme that fascinates me: adventures in a harsh, hostile, brutal, wild, and unexplored world.The local peoples have lived in isolation for too long: an era of change and Great Discoveries is coming, a time of cultural blending, and I invite you to live through this time with me. It’s time to chart the map of Taliskarn! Map of Malkona The map will be interactive, but right now, I am actively working on all the regions, and it gets updated almost daily. Cutting it into segments every time is an entirely unjustified effort, so for now, I am just posting it as an image. To open the full version (8k), click on the preview image below; at the bottom, there will be a link saying “Open in full size.”                The map of Malkona is regularly updated and expanded, with new locations and points of interest appearing.        Work in ProgressI’m actively working on creating Taliskarn right now. It’s an enormous amount of tasks, so at this stage, many pages on this website contain only the most basic information – my thoughts and ideas that I am gradually turning into reality. For more details on what’s coming next, you can check out the Roadmap; I regularly publish current updates in the Blog, and most importhantly, I’m always open to feedback. Even more than that – I’ll be incredibly grateful for it! If you have the time and inclination to read my notes, and if you happen to come up with any ideas, criticisms, or suggestions, please share them with me. All contact information is available on the About page and in the header.And thank you for your interest in Taliskarn! Regions of Malkona Currently, the continent and the surrounding lands are divided into 12 key zones. Each of them is a unique region with its own wonders, characteristics, peoples, monsters, customs, and drama. Choose where your journey through Taliskarn will begin!   Table of Content     Riku Highlands A land of mist, frost, ancient forests, and white rivers, home to the beast-like race of Kyonnhs. Read more.  Region ThemeMysticism of the primordial north, untouched coniferous forests, lost mines hidden in frozen mountain spurs, and the impenetrable stone fortresses of local clans. Regarding material culture, Riku is the only part of continental Malkona rich in metals, and the Kyonnhs are master blacksmiths. Verda Plains Vast arid steppes stretching for thousands of miles, the realm of free winds and the homeland of the resilient Arydars. Read more.  Region ThemeNomadic tribes, barbaric customs, a cult of hunting and ancestor worship, constant movement, and freedom. In terms of material culture and aesthetics, Verda heavily relies on bone craftsmanship: the Arydars traditionally craft weapons, ornaments, tools, and more from specially treated bones. “If you take down a Taurok, you use all of the Taurok.” Verda Forests In the northern foothills of Verda, along the lakes and rivers, lush temperate forests conceal the settlements of the pale-skinned Saltuars. Read more.  Region ThemeSpirit worship, Slavic/Japanese aesthetics (Shinto in terms of nature deification), and quasi-Celtic druidic motifs. Their material culture is rooted in stone and wood, with northern regions also utilizing metals. Verda South The southern coast of Malkona, home to the proud Prymars. Read more.  Region ThemeSeafaring, the ocean, an advanced civilization by Taliskarn’s standards. I envision the Prymars, their customs, and lands with motifs reminiscent of the Eastern Roman Empire – Byzantium – and partly the Spanish of the Conquistador era, but adapted to Taliskarn’s mood and realities. Their material culture heavily relies on the gifts of the Ocean while eagerly adopting whatever they can from neighboring peoples. This region also houses one of the largest cities in Taliskarn, Varmego – a place that, in time, will become the “capital of the world.” The Warm Sea A vast sea east of the continent, teeming with hidden currents. Here, before merging with the cold waters of the Ocean, the great current Amplectra makes its final stop, bringing life-giving warmth to the shores. Read more.  Region ThemeA melting pot of cultures, cultural exchange, city-states, seafaring. The Scarred Lands of Bruna Savannas and deserts in central Malkona, scorched by the ominous crimson sun – battlefields of the Age of Wonders, where the land has yet to heal from its wounds. Read more.  Region ThemeFantasy post-apocalypse, survival in deserts and wastelands, ancient artifacts and fortresses, war chimeras, and creatures twisted by Malkona’s cursed blood – Elgarim. Material culture revolves around Elgarim (a dense, earthen oil with wondrous properties), sand, glass, and ceramics. Bryleahn Jungles Lush jungles in western Malkona, the “Shimmering Lands,” home to the amphibian-like Bryleahns. Here, in the dense tropical forests along the azure Sanguama River, the continent’s most vibrant life thrives. Learn more.  Region ThemeJungles, living in harmony with nature, poisons, hunting. The local people, the Bryleahns, lag behind other nations in technological development but significantly surpass them in cultural depth and knowledge of nature. They are excellent alchemists and herbalists, and their tools are made from the transparent resin of local trees, lacrikael. Fetid Fens Poisonous swamps in the southwestern reaches of Bryleah, shrouded in clouds of foul, decaying vapors. Learn more.  Region ThemeMutations, diseases, twisted beasts and creatures, corruption, swamps. Noctaria The hidden lands, guarded by the Phantom Moon Tranca—the goddess who veiled her children, the Noctids, from the sun. The extraordinary life forms that have evolved here exist in a fragile harmony. Learn more.  Region ThemeMysticism, twilight, fluorescence, living atolls, adorable Noctids, telepathy and empathy, illusions and madness. Shards of Flammarg Scorched wastelands, separated from the rest of Malkona by the waters of the Boiling Sea—what remains of the ancient Flammarg Empire. In these deadly barrens, the outcast Flammars, the winged people of the Molten Lands, struggle to survive. Learn more.  Region ThemeVolcanoes, wastelands, rifts, fire, heat, rivers of molten glass. The foundation of the local material culture is volcanic glass. Wilderreach Taiga, followed by tundra north of the Warm Sea—vast cold plains ending in the Mirror Desert and arid foothills. Learn more.  Region ThemeStill under consideration, but tentatively, I see these lands as an uninhabited realm of contrasts, where giants coexist with tiny life forms. Perhaps gravitational anomalies will also be present, along with themes and vibes inspired by Bigby (*“Glory of the Giants,” a book dedicated to giants in DnD). Forbidden Isle of Irmaris Irmaris—the colossal stone with which the raging Ocean broke the back of his rebellious daughter, Fluere. The island’s flourishing lands bring only one thing to those who dare set foot on its shores: death. Learn more.  Region ThemePrimeval flora and fauna, insects, exotic diseases—the “lost world” of Taliskarn. The list will be expanded in the future with other locations, including the Regions of Wonders – such as the Valley of Origin and the Peak of Reflection – and areas still blank on Malkona’s map (such as the Far North).

Four of them are human, while the other four belong to non-human races:  Prymars (humans) Arydars (humans) Saltuars (humans) Brunars (humans) Kyonnhs (beastfolk) Bryleahns (amphibious-born) Noctids (alien-like humanoids, sensitive to sunlight) Flammars (winged folk of the fiery lands) Margin Scribble As the world evolves and is prepared for the release of DnD adventures, the number of peoples may well grow—minor races may appear, and so on. For example, fully canon merfolk have already joined the setting, just slightly adapted to fit. But these are the core inhabitants of Taliskarn, and their list is unlikely to expand until “supplements” come into play (for instance, the release of the Irmaris guide, which could very well introduce an insectoid race).

      "content": "I conceived Taliskarn as a setting that exists in two (so far, two) incarnations – more precisely, at two points in time: “Dark Time” and “New Dawn”. Taliskarn of the Dark Time “Taliskarn of the Dark Time” is the older chronological version of the world, ~500 AR. It is dedicated to the era when Malkona and its denizens reached the lowest point of their civilizational decline, shaping a grim and inhospitable low-fantasy setting:  the peoples live in isolation from each other, and even the relationships between immediate neighbors are, to say the least, very tense; the appearance of foreigners in most regions of Malkona attracts enormous attention, and they rarely receive a friendly welcome; miracles are mostly encountered only in myths, fairy tales, and legends (I don’t mean the wonders of the world, which abound, but rather active miracle-working, the “casters”) – and it is there that the great heroes have remained.I create “Dark Time” primarily for the planned world novels and for adventures using the Fate Core system. Taliskarn of the New Dawn This version of Taliskarn is set about 100–150 years ahead on the timeline from Dark Time, ~600–650 AR. The world is still harsh, unfriendly, and inhospitable, and at times downright brutal, but:  cultural interpenetration is in full swing, with multinational cities and states forming; sciences and arts are flourishing, and forgotten wonders are being revived; the inhabitants of the world are discovering it from new perspectives, as well as exploring previously unknown corners.One could say that here begins the Golden Age: the era of Great Geographical Discoveries in Taliskarn. It is this version of the world that I designate primarily for my dearly loved DnD adventures at levels 1–10.  Margin Scribble By its concept and design, Taliskarn is not very well suited for truly high-level magic – and I would personally approach long-distance mind-reading, teleportation, and resurrections with particular caution – but adventures at early and early-middle levels look quite promising.

The only thing known for certain is the command passed down for generations in Warmego, issued by Aurekho himself: ‘Not a single step shall mankind take upon the shores of the Forbidden Isle.’” “I’ve never been fond of absolute prohibitions, but finding a boat willing to sail to Irmaris is simply impossible!”  Note in the Margins Irmaris is a crucial element of the story I have planned, so I can’t reveal all the details just yet.

    "extras-stories-khurh-zan-ul": {
      "title": "Khurh-zan-ul",
      "content": "Margin ScribbleThis is an early version of the story’s prologue. I’m currently concentrating on the style and common principles of future texts (and trying to find good English names and terms). I’m not entirely happy with the pacing of the last third, but let it stay that way for now. I’ll come back to it in the future. Any feedback would be very welcome! Khurkh-zan-ul 8th month of the 480th year since the Return (3827th year since the Creation according to the Brilian calendar) Two and a half years had passed since the dry summer when Drenan, ruler of the great city of Varmego, united the scattered peoples of the verdant lands under the spear of the Father and bound them with His Word. The Unified Verda now stretched for thousands of miles: from the arid savannas of Bruna to the fertile shores of the Warm Sea, from the foothills of the Boundary Ridge—beyond which lay the lands of the beast-like Kyonnhs—to the coast of the Great Ocean. The wild Tondrantars, the calculating Kromrs, the fierce Malnurs, and even the cunning Varmars of Nordurbo—all had bowed to Drenan’s will. At least for now… Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhhu… Pop! A large bubble, quietly swelling above the lazily bubbling, foul-smelling brew in a stone bowl, burst loudly, distracting Barghyr from his sharpening. The youth had been toiling over a new needle since noon, and though the sun was slowly sinking toward the horizon, the work was far from done. Perhaps the task was moving so slowly because he was used to working deliberately and thoroughly, infusing every movement with conscious meaning. Or maybe the delay was due to the bones splashing in the cauldron: a large catfish had been caught in the nets that morning, and its bones would make fine belt clasps. Then again, it might have been the fact that, for the past two hours, young and lithe girls had been down by the shore rinsing canvas, and the wide windows of the workshop offered a truly mesmerizing view. Who could say? In any case, whatever Barghyr was doing—or daydreaming about—the loud pop above the cauldron made him flinch and snap back to reality. Rising from the table, he quickly crossed the room and peered anxiously into the stone bowl: had he overcooked it? Didn’t seem so… “Cooking up a storm?” The curtain of roughly tanned leather covering the entrance flew aside, letting in a noisy guest. “Phew! I was sure I was hungry, but if that’s your dinner, I’ve already eaten,” Ronan grimaced theatrically, waving a hand in front of his face. “Smells like something died. Yesterday. No, even earlier. And anyway…” He strode briskly to the workbench and leaned on it with his fists, peering out the window: “…aha, still here. So why were you staring into the cauldron? Had your fill already? Come on…”“Touch my balls, and I’ll knock you out,” Barghyr threatened lazily. Ronan snorted in disappointment, stopping a couple of steps away from the workshop owner, and raised his hands in mock surrender:“What can I do with you… Phew.” When the two stood side by side, it seemed there were no two more different people in all of Malcona. Barghyr, a descendant of the nomads of the great steppes, the Arydars, had already shot up so tall by the age of fourteen that he had to duck when entering some rooms. Slightly hunched, with awkwardly long arms and legs, he towered over Ronan like a gloomy old pine over a young ash tree. Barghyr’s long face, with its strong features, was tanned in the Arydar fashion, his narrow dark eyes looked at the world with assessing distrust, and his thick lips, with their slightly downturned corners, seemed perpetually on the verge of a dissatisfied grimace. Every movement of his radiated visible reluctance, and he tended to view everything around him with pessimistic skepticism, searching first and foremost for flaws, threats, and annoyances. Ronan, on the other hand, was his complete opposite: a child of mixed blood, he had drawn the lucky ticket at birth, inheriting only the best from both parents. Neither tall nor short, at twelve he was already built like a young Father: stately, broad-shouldered, predatorily agile, with clearly defined muscles beneath his bronze skin—give him another year or two, and many men of Nordurbo would have reason to worry. His face retained the smooth, even slightly rounded features typical of the Prymars, but added the sharpness and expressiveness characteristic of the Arydar people. A straight nose, a strong chin, thin, well-defined lips, and slightly narrow, almond-shaped eyes with an amber-golden hue that gazed at the world with unwavering, energetic curiosity. Add to this that Barghyr kept his black, coarse hair cut short, growing a small, neat beard, while Ronan gathered his chestnut locks with a golden sheen into a loose knot at the back of his head or left them completely loose. Barghyr wore the traditional leather clothing of the nomads, roughly tanned and generously adorned with intricately carved bone symbols, while Ronan preferred the usual Prymar togas or loose trousers and shirts made of soft fabric dyed with Noctidian purple, and his only adornments were a family amulet and a wide bracelet on his left wrist. In short, as mentioned earlier, you’d be hard-pressed to find two more different people—but such trifles didn’t bother these two in the slightest. Shaking his head in disappointment, Ronan glanced around the room and plopped down on the nearest chest. “A caravan from the Kromrs arrived. They brought spices from Bruna, a bit of this, a bit of that… And a little silver from the Kyonnhs.” The boy paused dramatically, watching for Barghyr’s reaction. “Uh-huh,” the dark-skinned youth nodded, bending over the cauldron again. “Heard ‘bout it.”“Heard about it!?” Ronan leapt up from the chest, bounded over to the craftsman, and slapped him on the back, enunciating clearly: “They brought silver. From the Kyonnhs. Sil-ver.”“Uh-huh,” Barghyr agreed again, not taking his eyes off the cauldron. “Like I said, I heard.”“You’re impossible…” Ronan took a deep breath, choked on the stench rising from the bowl, and broke into a coughing fit. “Cough-cough, ugh! Why do I even bother coming to this stinking hole of yours!? You’ve got a perfectly good room in the house! You can see the girls from there too!!!” Barghyr ignored this remark. After damping the fire under the cauldron, he carefully covered it with a heavy turtle-shell lid, returned to his table, sat down on the stool, and, leaning his elbows on his knees, stared intently into Ronan’s shimmering, enthusiastic golden eyes. After a few seconds of this staring contest, the dapper boy shook his head in mock offense: “You’re so dense! Listen up: the Kromrs. Brought. Silver. That means…”“It means they went north through Coppergrass,” Barghyr said with a heavy sigh. “To the Steps. Traded with the Kyonnhs. And came back. Right through Tondrantar territory.”“Exactly!” Ronan enthusiastically slapped his thighs, jumping to his feet again. “Precisely! So, they’re following…”“So, they’re following the Word and aren’t allowed to fight among themselves,” the host continued in the same displeased tone.“Well! Isn’t that amazing!?”“Amazing. I’m sure Mongar-suru likes it too. And when he comes to Shu-Guranbor for the winter, he’ll be in a good mood. And no one will have any trouble because of it. Right?”“Mongar-suru and all the other Tondrans will have to deal with it!” Ronan paced back and forth across the room, energetically waving his arms. “The world is changing, don’t you get it, Barghyr!? The wind is changing! And that means…”“It means there’s a storm coming.” Ronan groaned in frustration, rolling his eyes to the ceiling as if asking, “Why me, Father?” But then his mood shifted abruptly. He darted over to Barghyr, planted his hands on the table on either side of the seated youth, and grinned slyly right in his face: “And that too. That too! That’s exactly why I need you around, to whine in my ear and remind me how bad everything really is. So I don’t get carried away. And you,” Ronan straightened up and spread his arms in bewilderment, “for some reason, are never there. Why didn’t you come to the caravan meeting, huh?”“Because a smooth-skinned youth has no place at a council of men,” Barghyr replied with stone-cold calm, and Ronan winced as if from a toothache.“Again… You’re not a youth, you’re my rider! My senior rider! Isn’t that enough?”“No.” Barghyr scowled, raised a clenched fist in front of him, and began unfolding his fingers one by one: “A rider is a warrior. A warrior is a man. I’m not a man. I can’t be a warrior. I can’t be a rider.”“You’re impossible…” Ronan groaned again and irritably waved his hand toward the western wall. “That’s over there! But you live here! My riders will be whoever I choose, and let anyone dare mutter a word about those barbutar rituals!” The dark-skinned boy stubbornly furrowed his brow and rose threateningly from his seat:“I. I’ll have something to say about those rituals. I’m a tribesman of the Arydar tribes. These are my rituals, got it!?” For a few seconds, they glared at each other fiercely until Ronan finally gave in:“Just kick me already,” he grumbled, collapsing onto a stack of tanned hides in the corner. “Barbutar through and through.” For a while, silence hung in the room, broken only by the sullen grumbling of the two boys who had once again quarreled. This wasn’t the first time they’d argued about this, and Barghyr remained steadfast: true to his Arydar blood, he refused to call himself a man until he had undergone Khurkh-zan-ul. Khurkh-zan-ul—the rite of passage—was the most important ritual for any boy born into the Arydar tribes of the Great Plains. The harsh nomadic tribe clearly divided its men into -khur—boys, and -khar—grown men, and the line separating the two was precisely Khurkh-zan-ul. It took place in the final days of summer, when the beasts of the plains were well-fed and strong. At sunset, a father would come to his son and present him with a handcrafted ancestral talisman, the Sakhyr: a vertebra of the tribe’s totem animal, adorned with intricate runes invoking the ancestors. From that moment until the very end of Khurkh-zan-ul, the future man would not utter a single word. In silence, he would gather his bow and knife, leave the encampment, and head to the nearest sacred spring. There, he would spend a sleepless night without food or water, listening to the music of the steppe wind and calming his spirit. At dawn, the youth would set out into the steppe, tracking his future guardian. The stronger the beast he found, the more powerful a protector it would become, and the stronger his entire lineage would grow. But the boy would be cautious: the animal must be defeated openly and honestly, relying only on his bow, arrows, and courage—traps and trickery would insult the free spirit of the beast, anger it, and instead of gaining its protection, he would only invite misfortune. After succeeding in the hunt, the youth would return to the encampment with his prize. If the beast was too large for a single talard to carry its carcass, the hunter would take only the largest and strongest bone—and he would not forget to dip the Sakhyr into the hot blood, staining it crimson. The tribe would greet the hunter with jubilation. The bone he brought would be split into two parts: the smaller piece would become the first link of his Tuur-Khurrah—a talisman chain bearing the vertebrae of his guardians. The larger part would form the base of the Krynar: a long knife adorned with prayer runes, a symbol of an Arydar man’s dignity. Once the Tuur-Khurrah and Krynar were ready, the shaman would inscribe the youth’s first adult tattoo onto his skin: symbols of the defeated beast and the lineage strengthened by this victory. Then, the boy would speak his first adult words, the words of a man: Issar-Khurrah, the “oath to the bones.” The Sakhyr he brought, stained with the blood of the totem beast, would be added to the ancestral chain of the entire lineage, and the new man would take his place among the Arydars. Faithful to tradition and heritage, Barghyr stubbornly wished to follow the path of his ancestors—and Ronan, for the most part, had no issue with it… except for the fact that the stubborn boy didn’t truly have a lineage of his own. Barghyr was an orphan, the adopted son of Varek, the current ruler of Nordurbo and all the Varmars. Though the Varmars had drifted away from classical Prymar culture over the centuries since their separation from Varmego, they still adhered to the same principle regarding adoption as the Shield City: adopted sons or daughters became junior to biological children or those adopted earlier, but otherwise enjoyed the same rights and treatment. This made Barghyr a full-fledged brother to Ronan—and a beloved one at that—while also, in Ronan’s understanding, freeing the stubborn boy from the need to follow Arydar traditions and rules. Instead, it obligated him to abide by the rules established in Varek’s family. Barghyr fully agreed with the latter part, but as for the former… Ronan sighed heavily: “Alright, let’s go with a different wind. Sit still and keep quiet. Don’t say a word. Got it, tall one?” Barghyr raised his eyebrows in confusion as the curly-haired boy, rummaging behind the fold of his toga, deftly tossed something onto his lap. The lanky youth looked down, and his pupils widened in shock. “If you laugh, I’ll kill you,” Ronan warned. “Or at least try to maim you.” There was, admittedly, plenty to laugh about: the piece of bone that had landed on Barghyr’s lap was so poorly crafted that even an apprentice would have done better. A jagged, uneven edge, crudely scratched runes… It was a hack job, plain and simple. But laughter was the last thing on Barghyr’s mind: resting on his knees was half of Ronan’s ancestral amulet, made from the bone of the lord of the skies, the soaring Tensus whale. A more powerful guardian was hard to imagine… The youth looked up at his brother with stunned eyes, meeting his wide grin. “It’s mine, all mine,” Ronan said, showing the other half still hanging from a leather cord around his neck. “Just don’t blurt anything out, or you’ll ruin it. We’d have to wait another year.” Barghyr frowned, and the curly-haired boy stretched contentedly, raising his hands in a forbidding gesture: “No-no, keep your mouth shut! Open your ears instead—I’ll answer all your questions right now. First, it’s my amulet, my guardian, and my lineage! I can do what I want with it. Second, the Sakhyr doesn’t have to be given by a father—any senior member of the lineage can do it. According to our traditions, I’m older than you, right?” Barghyr, still sitting stiff as a rod, hesitated, then nodded uncertainly. “Exactly! Next: why isn’t the Warm Sea a sacred spring? Your idea is that lakes give life to the steppe, and the sea is a big lake. It gives life to us. And there’s plenty of wind here—Kaelesta loves the sea as much as the plains!” Ronan waited for another thoughtful nod, then leaned in conspiratorially and whispered loudly: “And they’ve seen traces of a shadowboar in the Shattered Bay.” He winked at the still-dazed craftsman, slapped him on the shoulder, and headed for the exit, tossing back an encouraging farewell: “Don’t shit your pants, and may the Father watch over you.” The Evening of the Next Day It took Barghyr almost an entire day to track down the shadowboar. These wild boars dwell only in the dense forests on the very edge of the Noctarian Wastes: blessed by the ghostly light of the Moon-Protector, Tranka, they skillfully conceal their presence in the shadows, avoiding the bright rays of the sun at all costs. During the day, the Shadowboar rests in deep pits beneath tree roots. Knowing this—and also that the delicate eyes of these creatures cannot tolerate light—hunters approach such dens during the hot midday hours and throw inside a burning clump of grass, oil-soaked tow, or simply a couple of torches. Awakened and blinded, the boar flies into a rage and charges out mindlessly, straight into the bright sunlight and the sharp spears of the Varmars. Alas, Barghyr found the den only at sunset, he was alone, and in his hands he held not a spear but a sturdy horn bow. The weapon with which you take down your guardian beast is the one it will respect, the one it will share its strength with, and for an Arydar, there is no weapon more significant or beloved than the bow. But arrows are not the best choice when an enraged boar is charging straight at you, especially one shrouded in shadowy mirage. The hunter knew all this perfectly well, but the mere thought of missing his chance and shaming himself in the eyes of his ancestors made the youth tremble. After a moment’s hesitation, Barghyr finally made up his mind. Kissing the Sakhyr, he took the oil-soaked tow from his belt and reached for his tinderbox… “Have you lost your mind!?” Ronan hissed in a fierce whisper, rolling out of the thick bushes to the right. “You’re going after a boar with a bow!?” Startled, Barghyr turned to his uninvited companion in indignation. “Here!” Ronan shoved a long spear with a thick shaft into his brother’s hands. Barghyr frowned and pushed the spear back.“Take it, I said!!!” Ronan was so furious he even started to whistle. “It won’t even notice your arrow, don’t be an idiot!” Barghyr stubbornly shook his head. “Take the damn spear!” Ronan finally roared louder than he should have, and a low, threatening growl answered from the dark hole beneath the roots of an old tree. The scuffling boys froze, slowly turning toward the den, now barely visible in the rapidly deepening twilight, and spotted two glimmering points of light.“SPEAR!!!!” Ronan screamed at the top of his lungs, his face pale. With an angry grunt, the boar charged at them. Barghyr shoved his brother aside, grabbed the spear, and barely managed to plant it in front of him, bracing the butt against the ground. Well, almost managed… With a ramming blow, the frenzied beast slammed into the hunter, and even the dim light of dusk faded for Barghyr. Some Time LaterShhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. The scraping sounds broke into Barghyr’s consciousness along with the pain. His head was spinning terribly—apparently, Ronan had given him a brew of sorrowweed… How bad must the pain be if even under the influence of the drug he felt like howling? He groaned weakly and opened his eyes. Above him, the treetops jerked past, and here and there, patches of the dark night sky peeked through. Shhhurkh, the hastily assembled drag made of branches creaked one last time, and the world finally came to a standstill. Between the sky and Barghyr appeared the swaying, exhausted figure of his brother: Ronan dropped to his knees beside the wounded boy and leaned in close, trying to catch his breath: “You’re so… Barghyr-khar… Heavy,” he coughed heavily but stubbornly continued. “And stupid. And heavy… And… Stupid… Almighty Father, I… Nothing… We’re almost at the shore.” The hunter shuddered and weakly stirred, trying to sit up. “Stay down,” Ronan, still coughing, pressed down on him. “And shut up. The boar’s done for.” The boy showed Barghyr his own hand, where the blood-soaked Sakhir dangled, tied with a cord. “We’ll get there soon,” Ronan tried to stand but swayed and fell back down, “and everything will be fine. We’ll draw you… a tattoo… write… heavy… and stupid…” With an incredible effort of will, Barghyr forced his body to move. He propped himself up on his elbow, grabbed Ronan by the back of the head with his other hand, pressed his brother’s forehead to his own, and hoarsely, barely audibly, spat out his first adult words: “You’re… stupid… You’re… dragging… and I’m… riding.” Exhausted, he fell back onto the drag and slipped back into unconsciousness with a satisfied smile, accompanied by his brother’s loud laughter.

However, the overall vibe should remain: these are thoughtful and reserved craftsmen, whose outward calm hides a beastly fury ready to ignite at any moment. In DnD terms, if considering stereotypical inclinations of the people, Kyonnhs are best suited as inventors and warriors. Kyonnhs—the “Prudent Tribe”—are tall humanoids who blend wild, animalistic features with a noble grandeur. Their faces resemble a mix of feline and lupine traits:  a broad, flattened nose like that of a snow leopard; a massive brow, pronounced supraorbital ridges, and deep-set, bright eyes with vertical pupils; large, sensitive ears with pointed tips on the crown of their heads; a heavy jaw and powerful fangs—not long enough to protrude beyond the mouth; a long mane: men trim it beneath the chin in a short beard-like fashion, while women weave it into intricate braids.Kyonnhs have gray skin, as they rarely see the sun due to constant mists. Thick, coarse fur grows on their necks, underarms, groin, behind the knees, and on their elbows. Kyonnhs are calm and deliberate, slow in judgment and thorough in decision-making, but behind this mask of cold-bloodedness slumbers an untamed, bestial fury—and may Dh’Fhalbh protect those who dare awaken it.               View of Baleymore          They are a people of skilled artisans and craftsmen. The lands of the Kyonnhs are rich in silver and other metals, and they have achieved remarkable proficiency in metalworking. They live in clans, build stone cities, forge metal weapons, armor, and tools, and for the most part, follow the Cult of Mastery: “understand the world by reshaping it according to your will.” The heart of the Kyonnhs’ world is the great city of Baleymore, standing at the center of their lands. This impregnable fortress hosts the council of master-elders from all clans, who gather to exchange knowledge and determine the fate of their people. ",

    "extras-stories-myth": {
      "title": "Myth",
      "content": "The Myth of Taliskarn Before the Beginning, there was the Ocean, and the Ocean was still. He slumbered a long sleep in the darkness of the Void, until the rays of the Sun touched his silent waters. At their light, the Ocean shuddered and drew a deep breath, awakening. From his tremor was born Fluere, Mother of All Currents, and from his breath, Kaelesta, Mistress of the Winds. The Ocean rejoiced as he beheld them, and thus began… The Time of Beginnings The Ocean granted his daughters freedom and tenderness, forbidding them only one thing — never to descend into his dark depths, where the long-slumbering flame lay hidden. The sisters were obedient and joyful: Kaelesta sang carefree songs in the heavens, and in harmony with that song, Fluere wove the flowing streams of water. For an eternity, it was so — until Solkalor, son of the Sun, beheld the graceful Fluere from his radiant heights. He loved her at first sight, descended into the Ocean’s realm, and she loved him in return. From their union, the first life took root in the Ocean’s waters. Thus began… The Time of Creation Solkalor and Fluere rejoiced, the Ocean looked upon their union with benevolence, and only Kaelesta grew sorrowful. Less and less did Fluere rise to meet her sister, and ever more wistful became the song of the skies. The Ocean, hearing his daughter’s grief, sighed, trembled, and parted his waters. Thus, the lands were formed. But the barren rocks unveiled by the Ocean were cold and lifeless. Seeing this, Solkalor shared his warmth with Kaelesta, but her gentle hands could not hold it — she let it slip into the Void. And so, Kaelesta’s loneliness deepened further. Fluere saw this and could not bear it. She broke the one command of her father, descended into the deepest abyss, and stirred the slumbering waters. Their movement awakened Ferrude, lord of Ardenféra, the Molten Depths. He struck the vault of the earth with his great hammer, and heaved the undersea stone. A thousand blazing craters burst forth upon the Ocean’s surface, warming the frozen waters and bringing heat to the land. Then the Ocean’s wrath turned upon his beloved daughter, and he was filled with turmoil. Great waves rolled across the seas, the land shook and cracked. Thus, the continents were formed. In his fury, the Ocean drove Fluere toward the nearest shore and hurled his body against the cliffs. His rage surged over the lands, and they would have drowned entirely, but Fluere wrapped her arms around them, shielding them with her own form. Mighty waves crashed upon her back, battering and tormenting her, yet she did not let them pass. Thus was born the great current of Amplectar, the Mother’s Embrace. Seeing her sister’s torment, Kaelesta wept bitterly. Her tears fell upon the land, becoming rivers and lakes. Solkalor sought to comfort her, warming her with his light, and from that warmth, many plants and beasts were born. On her knees, Kaelesta begged her father to forgive Fluere, but the wrathful Ocean would not listen. In despair, she soared into the sky and flew to the highest burning mountain. There, she fell to her knees before Ferrude himself, pleading for his aid. The mighty Ferrude agreed, but only if Kaelesta would give him her love. And so it was, and from their union were born the Flammars, the Flame-Winged. The Lord of the Molten Depths kept his word. He strode through his subterranean domain, drawing closer to the land, and once more struck the vault of the earth with his great hammer. The land surged and heaved around the great mountain of Ferrir, and from the waters rose blazing cliffs, shielding the land from the Ocean’s fury. These lands Ferrude gifted to his children, the offspring of Kaelesta, and they named them Flammarg. Then Solkalor, seeing Fluere’s weary form, lifted her in his arms and carried her to the green lands, where he hid her in a deep, cool lake. Thick blood flowed from Fluere’s wounds, staining the lake and the river it birthed with a sapphire hue, filling them with life. From these waters arose the children of Fluere, and they named the river Sanguama, the Mother’s Blood. Their lands they called Bryleah, the Shining Realm, and themselves, the Bryleahns. Thus began… The Time of Birth Yet the Flammars soon found Flammarg too confining; they had inherited their father’s tempestuous spirit and their mother’s love of freedom, and they would not be bound to a single land. They came to Bryleah, but they were rough and reckless. The Bryleahns wept, and Fluere grieved at the sight of her children’s suffering. She cast the Flammars back to their fiery mountains. Kaelesta saw this and sorrowed. She offered Fluere a pact — to divide all the lands equally. But Fluere replied, “Let your children remain in the lands of flame, and mine on the shining shores, but let no others walk the rest.” Thus did Bryleahns and Flammars become enemies, and Fluere and Kaelesta grew estranged. From that time, those lands were called Malkona, the Land of Strife. Anger took root in Kaelesta’s heart, and she bore a silent grudge. On a moonless night, she took on the form of Fluere and lay with Solkalor, bearing him two children: Aurehjo, the golden-haired giant, and Tranqa, the frail, pale-skinned maiden. She gifted them lands to the east of Bryleah and commanded them to people those lands with children of their own — ones who might one day aid the Flammars in vanquishing the Bryleahns. Aurehjo fulfilled his mother’s will. He begot children in his own likeness — tall and mighty — and named them Prymars, the Firstborn. Tranqa, in turn, gave life to a pale-skinned, fragile people like herself and called them Pulcars, the Beautiful. But the moment the Sun’s rays touched the Pulcars, they cried out in agony, writhing in torment. The Sun’s heat seared their white skin, burning both Tranqa and her children. Tranqa spread her arms wide, shielding her children, and ascended high into the sky. Kaelesta rushed after her on the wind, pleading, crying for her to stop, but her daughter would not listen. The ethereal wings of Tranqa burned away, and she remained forever hovering above the land, sheltering her people from the Sun’s wrath. Thus was born Noctaria, the Nightlands, and her children became the Noctides. Tranqa herself never set foot upon the land again, and the wondrous power within her offspring began to wane. Aurehjo’s children, however, were like Solkalor — fearless before the Sun, fertile, and strong-willed. They swiftly spread across the new lands and flourished. Solkalor saw all that had transpired and realized Kaelesta had deceived him. Rage overtook him. He forged a spear of pure light and hurled it at Tranqa, but the Mistress of Winds cried out in terror and shielded her daughter. The spear pierced her through, leaving a great wound. From that moment, the Sun above that place burned red with fury, and the Prymars who dwelled beneath it darkened under its fiery glare — thus were born the Brunars, the Brown-Skinned. Kaelesta, overcome with fury, soared toward the flaming mountains, gathered fire upon the winds of the sky, and carried it to Bryleah. The forests blazed, the Bryleahns screamed in agony, and Fluere trembled. She cast her waters over the shining lands, shielding her children from the raging wrath of the Storm Mistress. Seeing this, Solkalor’s fury burned ever hotter. He turned his blazing gaze upon Aurehjo’s children, seeking to destroy them. He dried up their rivers and lakes, withered their plants, and smote their beasts. Some of the Prymars fled into the deep forests, where their skin grew lighter and their hair darkened — thus they became the Saltuars, the Forest Dwellers. Others remained upon their scorched lands, enduring all that befell them, though they grew smaller in stature — these became the Arydars, the Children of Drought. Aurehjo beheld the suffering of his offspring and was enraged. He seized his father upon his shoulders and cast him down to the earth, shattering it all the way to Ardenfera, the Molten Depths. From the gaping wound in the land burst forth Ferrude’s burning breath, consuming the surrounding lands, parching them, turning them to dust. Thus were born the deserts. So great was the upheaval that Malkona split into three, its sundered lands drifting apart. Only then did Solkalor and Aurehjo cease their battle. Each took hold of the broken earth from opposite ends and pushed it together once more. The lands clashed, crashing against each other, rising into jagged peaks. Thus were born the mountains. Father and son gazed upon Malkona, now divided by its peaks, and realized there was nothing left to fight over. Fluere raged in vain, for the god of light had calmed and could no longer lift his hand against his own children. Pensive, he turned to the now-silent Kaelesta and bid her lift him to the highest summit. There he remained, lost in thought. From the thoughts of Solkalor were born gray-skinned and wise children, and they called themselves Kyommndaih, which means “The Prudent Tribe.” As for Kaelesta herself, fearing the consequences of her deeds, she ascended even higher into the sky, vowing never to return to the earth. Then Fluere grew wrathful beyond measure. She withdrew her waters from the lands and commanded her children to march eastward and strike down the children of Aurehjo. Thus, the Bryleahns waged war against the Prymars, Brunars, Arydars, and Saltuars, and the conflict lasted long. Golden-haired Solkalor and the Mother of Currents bestowed their people with great gifts, enabling them to perform wondrous and terrible feats alike. Thus began… The Time of Miracles But the forsaken children of Kaelesta grieved, and in their hearts, fury began to burn. The Flammars multiplied in great numbers, forging dreadful weapons in the molten depths of the mountains, and they descended upon the lands of Malkona like an unstoppable tide. Fluere and Aurehjo beheld the wrath of the flame-winged ones and understood that their children could not withstand such fury. Thus, they forged not peace, but a truce. From Aurehjo, Fluere bore Fluaht, the Patron of Pure Waters, and Kustopha, the Keeper of the Source. To her daughter, she entrusted the care of the living river Sanguama, and to her son, the fate of her children, the Bryleahns. Then, Fluere descended back into the sea, going forth to meet the raging Ocean. Enraged, the Ocean-father drove his defiant daughter toward the shores, striking her against the fiery cliffs of Flammarg, shattering them. Mighty waves poured into the blazing abyss, the sea boiled, and Flammarg was no more. With the last of her strength, Fluere embraced Malkona once more with a warm current. Yet, she never forgave Solkalor’s betrayal: along the shores of Bryleah, she placed her hands close; by the lands of Aurehjo, she kept them at a distance; and at the farthest edge, she did not close them at all. Thus came to be the warm shores and the cold shores. As for Aurehjo, he gathered the Prymars around him and descended into the molten depths of Ardenfera to subdue the raging Ferrude. To the Brunars and Arydars, he decreed that they should honor the deeds of their ancestors but shape their lives as they wished — yet the Saltuars did not emerge from their forests to follow their father. And so, he named them Humans. Fluaht, mourning his mother’s fate, sought to bestow upon the Bryleahns all manner of gifts and wonders. He generously revealed to them the secrets of alchemy and the world, teaching them the mysteries of healing wounds and prolonging life. Kustopha, seeing this, said: “No river flows forever; every current must have its beginning and its end.” Her brother opposed her, and thus Fluaht and Kustopha quarreled. Kustopha cast out her brother and his followers from the blooming shores of Sanguama into the misty, fetid swamps. Overcome by sorrow, their minds darkened, their bodies and thoughts became twisted. Thus were born Flumorn and the Nablings. Exhausted from her quarrel with her brother, Kustopha descended into the Lake of the Source and fell into a deep slumber. Thus, the progenitors of the Bryleahns abandoned Malkona, and the wondrous power within their children began to wane. The forsaken Bryleahns grew fearful and restless. They climbed into the mountains, calling loudly upon Solkalor, but it was not he who answered them — only the beast-like and fearsome Kyommndaih emerged to meet them. The Bryleahns found their name difficult to pronounce and instead began calling their neighbors Kyönnhi. The Kyönnhi proclaimed that they named their progenitor Dh’Fhalbh, meaning “The Departed.” Solkalor had left Malkona, and his children lived by their own wisdom, placing no faith in their forebears, shaping their lands as they saw fit by their own will and desire. The beast-like ones showed the Bryleahns their stone cities, their deep mines, and their strange, wondrous tools. The Bryleahns grew even more afraid and did not trust the Kyönnhi, believing they must have slain Solkalor and, through his flesh, gained the power to perform miracles. Gathering all their strength, the Bryleahns ascended the mountains in force, but the Kyönnhi drove them back to the shore. The Kyommndaihh seized the Valley of the Source and settled there, advancing no further. From that time on, the Bryleahns were forced to come before the Kyönnhi in supplication, begging for permission to see Kustopha. Meanwhile, the Humans and the Noctides lived in their own lands, waging no great conflicts against one another and no longer witnessing the light of the progenitors. Thus began the Dark Time. ",

However, the overall vibe should remain: my main reference for the Prymars is the Eastern Roman Empire—Byzantium—adjusted for certain aspects of the world (particularly their current small population, the scarcity of metals in their lands, their militaristic leanings, and several other features). In DnD terms, if we consider the stereotypical inclinations of the people, Prymars make excellent paladins, clerics, and sorcerers. Prymars—the descendants of the golden-haired giant Aurehjo, the first created humans, who have remained almost unchanged since ancient times. Tall and mighty, with golden curly hair and bronze skin, they seem to have stepped straight out of myth… though that does not necessarily make them superior. Physically, Prymars possess great strength and striking beauty, but they are not particularly resilient. They struggle with hunger and deprivation and suffer greatly from disease. Morally, they are characterized by ambition and self-assurance: the First Children firmly believe that it was they whom the Father entrusted with ruling the world. Prymars prefer to settle in coastal, warm lands, never straying too far from the ocean. They are excellent sailors and fishermen, daring enough to challenge even the mighty leviathan sea beasts. The Ocean itself has become one of their key cultural pillars: their main festivals are tied to it, they gather food from it, and they use it as a source of materials. Lacking free access to metals from the north, Prymars make extensive use of the hides and bones of sea creatures. In terms of knowledge, Prymars have advanced further than most in military affairs, engineering, and agriculture. They have developed sophisticated soil cultivation techniques, build aqueducts, craft powerful crossbows, and possess the secret of liquid fire. Prymars worship the Father (Aurehjo) and see it as their duty to unite all humans under his rule. ",

      "content": "“To the north of Malkona, separated from the rest of the continent by the impassable Border Ridge, a mysterious land hides beneath the clouds—Riku. The rivers here are white and cold as ice, yet no matter how much you drink from them, your thirst is never quenched; only a faint, chalky sweetness lingers on the tongue. The forests are so tall and dense that if you lift your gaze to the sky, all you will see above are thick, coniferous canopies. A misty haze forever clings to the ground, obscuring everything beyond a few dozen steps—the world simply vanishes into the fog. And I cannot shake the feeling that no matter how far I travel, something vast and dangerous stalks me at the very edge of that mist, its watchful, measuring gaze never leaving me. Sometimes, on a rare clear midday, the fog recedes, and with it, those lurking shadows retreat as well. But in the end, they always return. It is no surprise that the local inhabitants—the beastlike kyonnhs—surround their settlements with such formidable stone walls. Alas, convincing them to share their knowledge is no easy task (but I have not abandoned my attempts!)” Here and in the following pages, I present excerpts from the epoch-making work “Notes on Taliskarn, Its Wonders, and the Creatures That Inhabit This World.” The Central North of Taliskarn—Riku, also known as “Whitewater”—is an inhospitable and frigid highland. Enclosed by towering ridges, eternally shrouded in mist, and bristling with impenetrable forests, this land has become home to the hardy and tenacious beastlike kyonnhs. The mountains of Riku are rich in metals, and the white rivers teem with fish, but the path to these riches is fraught with peril. In the fog-laden woods, massive northern wolves and bears prowl as grim shadows, stone giants slumber upon the mountain slopes, and as for what might dwell in the depths of the mines… even the kyonnhs themselves prefer to speak of it only in hushed whispers.  Key Themes and Ideas of Riku    The atmosphere of a wild, primordial northern forest: colossal trees, thick mists, and biting cold—echoes of Norse sagas.  The only region truly rich in metals, where blacksmithing and craftsmanship have flourished.  Cities are dense stone fortresses with cyclopean walls, designed with practicality and defense in mind.  Kyonnh society is divided into clans, each safeguarding its own secrets and mysteries, yet they do not openly war with one another.  Adventures here revolve around exploring untamed forests and deep mountain mines, with perhaps a touch of “northern horror”—enemies are rare but formidable, and while the land is not outright hostile, you are an outsider here, and the true masters of these forests may yet take notice of you.

In DnD terms, if we consider the stereotypical inclinations of the people, Saltuars are a great choice for rogues, bards, and druids. Saltuars are the people who have made the forests of Verda their home. Cunning and agile, they easily conceal their presence among the trees, setting traps and safeguarding the secrecy of their settlements—not only from outsiders but even from one another. Saltuars have fair skin, long noses, thick red hair in most cases, and green eyes. The men wear long beards, which they braid in a distinctive manner—each knot holding a special, sacred meaning. They build their homes from logs and sustain themselves through hunting, fishing, and cultivating lakeside lands. Some clans living in the foothills mine and refine metals, trading their work with the Aridars. Saltuars believe in the spirits of nature—they are convinced that every entity has its own spirit, and each can be bargained with.

And to this day, these lands bear terrible scars, from which oozes the thick, dark-blue ichor of poisoned Malkona’s blood: elgarim. If you see the crimson glow of the Wrathful Eye ahead, halt, traveler following in my footsteps, and think long and hard before proceeding. What lies before you is suffocating heat, the fury of wild chimeras, the ghosts of long-finished battles—and perhaps, if luck favors you, a few forgotten secrets of the Age of Wonders (which, by the way, will most certainly try to kill you). Take my advice, turn around, and leave. But if your curiosity burns as fiercely as mine, pull your hood low over your face and step forward—into the Scarred Lands!” Here and beyond, I present excerpts from the epoch-defining work, “Notes on Taliskarn, Its Wonders, and the Creatures That Inhabit This World.” The Scarred Lands are among the most deadly and unforgiving places in Taliskarn. If you seek adventures in a dark, fantasy post-apocalypse setting—a world barely struggling to rise from centuries of stagnation—then Bruna is the perfect choice. Key Takeaways (open if you're too lazy to read the full page but still curious)Core themes and ideas behind Bruna:Fantasy post-apocalypse: a war with divine forces left the land scarred, filled with anomalies, ancient weapons, and war-forged creatures.Elgarim: the \"Cursed Blood of Malkona\"—tar-like pools capable of raising \"mummies\" and serving as a source of energy.The crimson sun, under which no one can survive unprotected.The aesthetic of deserts and perilous savannas on the borders.Ghosts and the restless past lingering in the southern savannas.Dark-skinned inhabitants, born warriors who have rejected the gods and built a culture around human excellence—a Spartan-like society with a Taliskarn twist.Secrets of forbidden alchemy and the creation of monsters—chimeras.Adventures centered on survival, exploration, ancient fortresses, and uncovering hidden knowledge.   Table of Content     Wonders All—or almost all—of the wonders of the Scarred Lands are directly tied to the legacy of the wars from the Age of Wonders. Some of them include: The Wrathful Eye “According to well-known Mythology, at the twilight of the Birth Time, the enraged Scorcher hurled his spear into the body of Tranqa, seeking to rid himself forever of his unwanted daughter. Kaelesta, Mistress of the Winds, shielded her beloved child, and the Scorcher’s blazing spear tore a gaping hole through her ethereal form. Since then, no salvation from the deadly rays of the Great Sun has existed over this place in Malkona—it burns in the sky as a sinister crimson disk, seeking to obliterate all life. A beautiful legend—and, by the Moon-Guardian, around noon, I begin to think it might be entirely true.” The sun over Bruna shines in a deep crimson hue: the closer you approach the heart of the desert, the darker and more menacing this shade becomes, and the more merciless the heat of the Great Light’s rays. Mortals call it the “Wrathful Eye,” preserving the memory of Solkalor’s fury. The Wrathful Eye grants no chance of survival to the plants and animals common in the rest of Malkona: leave a naked man at the desert’s edge in the morning, and by sundown, his skin will be completely stripped away. Only those who can escape the searing gaze of the crimson sun can endure in these lands—along with the chimeras and elgarim wanderers (see below). Echo of War A grim legacy left upon the Scarred Lands by the wars of the Age of Wonders:               An illustration of a chimera or a wandering fortress will be here           Wandering fortresses and strongholds. Walking bastions—another symbol of the Age of Wonders. Most of them have long perished, swallowed by the sands, but you never know what you might encounter in the heart of the desert. Chimeras. Horrific creatures crafted by the alchemists of old—or perhaps by the gods themselves—whose sole purpose is to sow chaos and destruction. See more in the “Bestiary” section. Dead Mirrors. Sometimes, travelers stumble upon small desert lakes, their surfaces covered with a dull blue elgarim film (see below). At the bottom of each of these pools rests the body of a warrior from ages past—and if a wanderer is mad enough to submerge their face into these waters, the guardian of the spring will reveal their memories. Please them, and you shall be rewarded; fail, and you’ll have no one to blame but yourself.Geography The Scarred Lands stretch 800 miles deep into Malkona, from the southern coast to the Zul’ar Crater, and 500 miles west to east, from the foothills of the Windbreaking Mountains to the Sparsewood Plains.  To Be Announced I will return to further detailing this section during the development of adventures in the Scarred Lands. Bordering Savannas Vast savannas at the very edge of the Sparcewoods—this is where the sparse forests of western Verda gradually transition into the Scarred Lands, bathed in crimson light. It is a windy and untamed frontier, a place where two biomes and cultures collide. Mighty lions bask in the shade of scattered trees, exotic long-legged birds quench their thirst at oases, and in the sun-scorched thickets of brittle shrubs, plains hyenas lie low, pressing against the earth.  To Be Announced I will return to this region after Verda is fully completed to ensure a proper and harmonious gradient between the steppes and Bruna. The Desert of Cursed Blood The hottest and deadliest place in the Scarred Lands. These white dunes are home to wild chimeras, elgarim-born monsters, sand-buried fortresses, and dense lakes where Malkona’s cursed blood gathers. The Weeping Savannas At the very south of the Scarred Lands—where the Amplectra trade winds graze the continent and still carry a touch of life-giving moisture to the parched soil—wild savannas stretch wide. Listen closely, traveler, and you will hear soft moans in the ceaseless whisper of the wind: the locals say it is Flueré mourning her fate, disturbing the rest of the fallen. My own observations suggest that these sounds are most likely nothing more than the wind whistling through the tangled stalks of thorny grass, but one fact remains: the dead rise. The Weeping Savannas are hot, windy tropical plains. Rare oases are lost in the tall swaying yellow sea, and the burial mounds of ancient battles have long been overgrown with grass. Wandering chimeras rarely stray here, the Wrathful Eye does not scorch these lands as mercilessly, and it may seem that one could live here—but listen. Do you hear the wind’s wailing grow louder? Know that this is no illusion: the ghosts are coming. Elgarim Elgarim is both the dire curse and the unexpected blessing of the Scarred Lands. In the places where the fiercest battles of the Age of Wonders were fought, sluggish lakes of thick, dark-blue resin ripple lazily, their depths swallowing even the Wrathful Eye’s rays without a trace. Some believe that elgarim is the cursed blood of Malkona itself, unable to endure the raging fury of the Progenitors. Others claim it is the thickened blood of warriors who perished in the wars of old. I have even heard grim legends that all the desert’s sands are nothing more than the decayed flesh of the fallen, beneath which endless tar-like lakes of their cursed blood churn. Blood that has become so vast in volume that it can no longer remain hidden beneath the surface. Simple arithmetic leaves not a shred of coral upon coral in support of this belief, yet in the name of folklore study, I record this… theory in the pages of my work.” Elgarim is one of the few materials capable of withstanding the heat and lethal energy of the Wrathful Eye, making it the foundation of Bruna’s material culture:  When mixed with sand in precise proportions, the locals create a rapidly hardening stone composite, elgalite, used to build their cities and fortifications. Combined with ash and ground fibers of desert thornbush, artisans craft durable ceramics. Adding red quartz sand—crimsonite—to the mixture allows for the creation of Bruna’s famed crimson glass, crimsor. It produces sharp (but brittle) blades, which are set into ceramic hilts as cutting edges. Soaking woven thornbush fibers in elgarim oil, filtered through layers of sand, results in incredibly strong ropes.And so on and so forth. However, only “pure elgarim,” refined through complex alchemical rituals, is suitable for craftsmanship. In its raw state, the cursed blood carries a powerful charge of distorted life energy, twisting and enslaving those it touches, stripping them of reason. The Scarred Lands are rife with maddened chimeras and wild wanderers—humans and beasts alike, who stumbled into an elgarim spill by chance. Brunars Telling of the wondrous properties of elgarim, I cannot help but write a few words about the madmen who dive into its eerie depths entirely of their own free will. These are harsh—one might even say ruthless, much like the lands surrounding them—dark-skinned people, in whose minds the fiery rage of a warrior and the cold calculation of an alchemist coexist in the most peculiar way, inspiring awe with their depth of knowledge and laughable superstitions, their respect for the Progenitors and their fierce hatred toward them.               Depiction of a Brunar against the desert backdrop           Work in Progress The people, culture, and customs of the Brunars are outlined in broad strokes. In the future, they will be refined, expanded, and given a dedicated page. Brunars—those who live under the red sun of Bruna—are a people of mighty warriors and skilled alchemists. Dark-skinned and golden-eyed, tall and strong, they have survived for years amidst a deadly climate and hostile neighbors, which has taught them to rely not on the protection of higher beings, but on themselves and their own strength. Brunars follow the “Path of Trials,” placing above all else the glory of physical strength and the mastery of intellect. They are resilient and proud warriors, erecting impregnable fortresses in the heart of the desert: they rarely display aggression toward their neighbors but will not allow anyone to set foot on their lands without permission. The people of Bruna wear their scars with pride but reject the intentional mutilation of their bodies—unlike their eastern neighbors, the Arydars, whose culture of adorning skin with intricate markings is seen as filthy and barbaric. Few can rival the Brunars in their mastery of melee weapons or their resilience to extreme heat. They are inclined to accumulate knowledge and wealth, knowing the worth of every object. The Brunars are relatively few in number, but their great heroes remain with them. When a warrior feels their time is drawing to a close, they journey into the heart of the desert, to the sacred elgarim lakes, and descend into their viscous depths. If the warrior is strong enough in spirit, they will be reborn as an Eternal (see below), return to the city of Kael-Nur, and become one of its tireless guardians. If their spirit proves too weak… well, the ranks of the wild wanderers will grow by one more lost soul. Cities and Settlements As I have already mentioned, most of Bruna’s territories are either sands scorched by the Wrathful Eye or the ghost-ridden, mystical Weeping Savannas. To settle in these deadly lands, one must be either a madman or a fool, and among the Brunars, one rarely finds either (unless, of course, one considers their entire Path of Trials madness). In any case, most settlements are found near the oases of the eastern plains, close to the very border with the Sparcewoods. However, there are two major—given the context, I would even say grand—exceptions to this rule: the City of the Starry Sky, Kael-Nur, and the Alchemists’ Terraces, Ur-Taruk.  Work in Progress Below, only the core idea, appearance, and general mood of these cities are described. I will return to the detailed development of Kael-Nur and Ur-Taruk during the release of the guidebook “Notes on the Scarred Lands.” Kael-Nur, City of the Starry Sky               View of Kael-Nur          Kael-Nur is the capital of the Scarred Lands and the largest city in all of Bruna. Out of two. Its dark-blue walls rise above the shores of the bay, and it is the only port in the region. This is a city that glorifies human strength and potential, where the Path of Trials was born and continues to thrive.Population: ~3000 people, 485 AR. Districts  Residential district; Port; “Dry port” (for desert caravans); Market; The Beginning of the Path (schools, temple, public buildings); Residential areas.Architecture The buildings of the Brunar capital are constructed from elgalite blocks, whose dark-blue surfaces glimmer with the reflected light of white grains fused into the solidified mass. Their appearance evokes the way distant stars sparkle in the night sky, which is why the city was named Kael-Nur, the City of the Starry Sky.  To Think AboutPerhaps elgalite is used only for external fortifications and high roofs due to its “radiation.” The main reason for this decision is aesthetics: purely dark-blue cities would look monotonous. It would be better to preserve visual diversity, keeping the dark shade as an accent. For example, residential buildings made of sandstone—light-colored—with dark-blue domes and canopies… The Brunar construct their homes at two, and rarely three stories high (primarily, only fortifications and public buildings in the center reach greater heights), raising the first floor well above the scorching ground. It is common for neighboring buildings to be connected by bridge-like extensions, allowing residents to avoid descending into the oppressive heat near the surface. Kael-Nur itself is encircled by mighty three-layered walls: the space between two rings of elgalite is filled with sand, providing reliable insulation against both the external heat and the dangers of the Scarred Lands. Standing on the southern border of the Cursed Blood Desert, the city would be entirely uninhabitable due to the Wrathful Eye, but its salvation came in the form of the Starry Domes. Cascading in a delicate lattice, they sway in the wind, reliably shielding its streets from the withering crimson light. These domes are built on hollow elgalite columns, allowing air to circulate freely inside them. Their surfaces are made from fabric soaked in elgarim oil, stretched over flexible, resilient rods of sun-reed. This dark-blue fabric reflects most of the sun’s rays, while gutters running underneath collect the condensation forming on the inner surface—precious moisture. If one were to rise into the sky—even if only in thought, which should pose no challenge to an inquisitive mind—they would see that Kael-Nur resembles an upturned fishing boat, oriented from sunset to sunrise. The same shape is echoed in individual buildings, and the reason is the ever-present winds sweeping through these lands: if the buildings were positioned otherwise, Celesta’s breath would effortlessly tear away their delicate domes. Which, to be fair, still happens from time to time. At night, when the Wrathful Eye sinks below the horizon, many of the domes are drawn aside, allowing the starry light and the—by Bruna’s standards—refreshing air to enter the city. Ur-Taruk At the very eastern edge of Bruna’s lands, like a giant scorpion sinking its claws into the flesh of the Windbreaking Mountains, lies the enigmatic Ur-Taruk, the abode of alchemists. Here, the keepers of forbidden knowledge from the time of Wonders continue their experiments. The air within its ancient walls is thick with the scent of boiling elgarim, strange intoxicating compounds, and perhaps even metals… At least, that’s what I assume: alas, outsiders are not welcome here, and I was unable to get inside.               View of Ur-Taruk          Ur-Taruk is a citadel of alchemists, who have taken over a miraculously preserved human bastion on the very border with Bryleah. A treacherous, narrow path winds its way up the slope, leading to the rocky caves that house the city. The path ends at mighty gates, above which gleams the reddish eye of Solkalor’s Gaze: a polished crimsonite mirror capable of focusing the light of the Wrathful Eye into a searing beam of terrifying power. One of the marvels that has survived from the era of the Forebears. The city is also guarded by chimeras—grotesque creations born in its caves from the twisted genius of the alchemists. Population: ??? inhabitants, 485 AR. Districts  The Bastion The Labyrinth of Alchemical Forges The Gardens The Overlook Square The Hermits’ Cells ???Architecture The walls of Ur-Taruk are the mountain itself, permeated through and through with the toxic fumes of elgarim. The levels are connected by spiral staircases, and the bridges between them hang on dark chains of ashgar—an alchemical alloy that fears neither rust nor time. When viewed from below, Ur-Taruk resembles a giant scorpion coiling its black rings around the rock. By day, it hides in the shadows, lazily basking in the sun, but at night, the mountain’s surface ignites with dozens of bright lights—the ancient crucibles are lit. Instead of Star Domes, Ur-Taruk’s terraces are covered with chimera-skin screens, which reflect the sun just as well. Al-Sharut Oasis (Flame of the Desert) The last settlement before the heat of the Wrathful Eye becomes unbearable—or rather, a cluster of settlements and encampments along the shores of the Three Lakes.  To Be Announced A draft of a point of interest, to be revisited once Sparcewoods and Verda are completed in bulk. Al-Sharut is intended to serve as a buffer zone between the cultures of the Arydars and the Brunars, a trade settlement on the border of Bruna and Sparcewoods. Caravanserai Gal-Hur’at, “Giant’s Palms”               Landscape of Gal-Hur’at          About halfway from Al-Sharut Oasis to Kael-Nur, on the eastern border of the Cursed Blood Desert, giant bone palms rise from the sand in a towering arch. Chimeras and desert beasts have the natural caution to avoid this place, unlike humans: in the shadow of this phenomenon, they have set up camp. Gal-Hur’at is a small settlement along the trade route through Bruna. Beneath the bone palms looming over the dunes, like a spider in a web, stretches the “netted encampment”: hammocks, suspended walkways, and cage-like storage units. The reason for this unusual architecture lies in local beliefs: beneath the Palms sleeps a monster from the Age of Wonders. Disturb it, and the gates to the underworld will open, dragging you beneath the dunes in an instant. That is why there is no stone, no clay, no elgalite—only nets swaying above the sand. The floors here are woven from ropes soaked in elgarim, the walls made of reed mats, and the roofs replaced by hides of sand lizards stretched between the “fingers.” Even fires are lit in suspended braziers, so as not to disturb the sand beneath. Rumors whisper that, from time to time, a mysterious figure appears among the Palms at night, shrouded from head to toe in a hooded cloak. This enigmatic merchant offers artifacts of ancient times in exchange, asking for nothing in return but the dreams of travelers—or so they say. Other Inhabitants Although I hardly use canonical DnD monsters and races (especially from Faerûn) in my version of the Wasted Lands, you can freely introduce any desert-themed creatures that suit your vision. For example, here are some broad strokes:  Minotaurs of the Cursed Labyrinths: Who said that the wars of the Age of Wonders were fought only on the surface? Deep within the winding catacombs beneath Bruna, minotaurs—descendants of warriors who once followed the Forebears—may still dwell. Their horns are cracked, and thick blue blood, poisoned by elgarim, runs through their veins. Nagas of Al-Sharut: Desert snakefolk might rule over the oases, trading water for the memories or emotions of travelers. Their queen wears a crown adorned with shards of Solkalor’s Gaze and is rumored to see across the ages. Gnoll Wanderers: Tireless hunters, whose packs pose a threat even to large caravans. Their hides are covered in elgarim-drawn patterns, and they revere as their god Tyer’r-ghu—a chimera that long ago escaped from Ur-Taruk and made its lair at the desert’s edge.You are free to populate Kael-Nur with tieflings, turn the alchemists of Ur-Taruk into aarakocra—the cursed children of Kelesta with scorched wings—it’s all in your hands!  Margin Scribble I quite like the aarakocra idea myself—perhaps it shall be so. Bestiary of the Wasted Lands  To Be Announced At this stage of worldbuilding, this section contains narrative descriptions of creatures and monsters envisioned for Bruna. In the future, more detailed entries and gameplay recommendations will be added, while full stat blocks and refined lore are planned for the Wasted Lands Guidebook. Bruna is home to bizarre wildlife that has adapted to the scorching wrath of the Furious Eye, as well as the wild nightmares of the Age of Wonders—chimeras. Some of them are described below, but feel free to expand the bestiary with any fitting creatures. Sand elementals, djinn, sand wyverns, desert ogres, liches, mummies—anything you can imagine. Three-Humped Scaled Camels Mighty beasts of burden for the desert caravans: their humps do not store water but thick elgarim, which is metabolized into energy. Their armor-like scales protect them from both the Furious Eye and raging sandstorms. Elgarim Golems The wardens of the Rifts—elementals of elgarim, often containing fragments of ancient artifacts (such as Solkalor’s mirrors). They roam near the Rifts, guarding the cursed blood, and their path is marked by blackened sand. The Eternal Immortal guardians of Kael-Nur—warriors poisoned by elgarim, who have lost their minds but remain unwaveringly loyal to their duty and the ideals of the Trial Path. Elgarols (Wanderers) Unlucky or weak-willed mortals who perished in elgarim spills. Their bodies are half-transformed into elgarim mass, half-preserved in cursed blood. Their eyes are hollow voids, and black smoke drifts from their mouths. Wraiths of the Weeping Savannas Shadows of past soldiers, trapped in an endless loop of their final battle. They pass through walls, leaving behind scorched grass. Sand Squids Spawned from Flueré’s wrath during the wars of the Age of Wonders. Giant hybrids of stingrays and squids that silently glide beneath the sands—their vibrations can be felt from hundreds of steps away, inducing an eerie unease. Locals tell terrifying legends of the “singer of the sands.” Sand Medusas “Umbrellas” Creatures resembling giant jellyfish with “domes” woven from sand threads. Beneath them hang tentacles of molten sand. They feed on the light of the Furious Eye and curl into a stone-like ball at night. Chimeras of Bruna Chimeras are either remnants of the Age of Wonders (monsters that continue to self-replicate in ruined fortresses, see Points of Interest) or twisted creations of the alchemists of Ur-Taruk.  Scorpiowings: Large flying scorpions with tails tipped with capsules of boiling oil. Their carapaces bear glowing runic symbols. They can fire streams of molten elgarim up to 30 feet. Their wings emit a hum that disorients their prey. They guard fortress ruins and rarely stray far. Bone Jackals: Elgarim-shrouded wraiths with sharp bone splinters protruding from their forms. They hunt in packs, prowling the desert. Ceramic Manticores: Lion-like bodies, scorpion tails, human faces, and reinforced ceramic plating—ghastly products of alchemical artistry. They spew sand mixed with shards of crimson glass, capable of piercing even sturdy armor. They whisper curses in an ancient tongue, inducing paralysis. Found only in Ur-Taruk… unless some have escaped. Elgarim Chameleons: Beneath their translucent skin, bubbling elgarim is visible coursing through their veins. Upon death, they explode, splattering their surroundings. They excel at blending with the sand and striking from ambush. Scouts and saboteurs of the Age of Wonders. Mirror Spiders: Weaving webs from glass threads, they serve as both attendants and guards in ancient fortresses.Points of Interest The lands of Bruna, ravaged by the fierce conflicts of the Age of Wonders, conceal many grim secrets. The ruins of ancient fortresses and strongholds, forgotten burial grounds, and lands forever warped by divine wrath—this is a region of anomalies and the dark legacy of wars that once thundered across it. Here are some locations that may capture your interest: The Frozen Fortress of Ir-Tul’ran Half-sunken in the Elgarim Lake at the very heart of the desert, the citadel of Ir-Tul’ran stands as a dreadful relic of the Age of Wonders: one of the walking fortresses that was forever abandoned by life. Now, the colossal polygon looms motionless over Bruna’s white sands, its dark elgalite walls gleaming ominously, while only the twisted shadows of scorpowings flit through its lifeless embrasures.  Margin ScribbleIr-Tul’ran is one of Bruna’s fallen wonders: a colossal polygonal structure of dark-blue basalt and red glass, resembling a squid with a dozen “tentacle”-towers. Its hull is cracked and riddled with breaches, from which viscous drops of elgarim ooze as if the fallen titan is bleeding dark ichor. Within, players will uncover the grim secrets of a bygone era, face the ever-vigilant chimeras, evade slumbering traps awaiting their time, and, of course, uncover ancient artifacts. El-Shakar, “The Star of Birth” Halfway between Kael-Nur and the oasis at the heart of the Weeping Savannas, right on the desert’s edge, sprawls the cursed fortress of El-Shakar—a place where the twisted alchemists of the Age of Wonders created their grotesque monsters: the chimeras. Its yawning gates should have long been buried by the sands, yet they stand invitingly open, beckoning the traveler to step inside and uncover the mysteries hidden within.  Margin ScribbleEl-Shakar, “the laboratories of the forgotten,” is a five-rayed underground fortress eager to tell adventurers the history of the chimeras, to initiate them into the secrets of creating these wondrous hybrids, and, of course, to challenge them with deadly trials. I’ve heard that the alchemists of Ur-Taruk call this place “the living fortress”—and perhaps, there is some truth to that. Shi’Rax, “The Crimson Whispering Forest” A hundred miles west of Ir-Tul’ran, above the sea of sands, rise the fragile spires of the crimsonite forest of Shi’Rax. Forever fused into a single monolith by the Gaze, the grains of its intricate arches hold memories of long-passed times. Memories that Shi’Rax is more than willing to share—if, of course, your mind can withstand it.  Margin ScribbleThe glass forest of Shi’Rax is a crimsonite canyon glistening under the red rays of Brunar’s sun, a domain of illusions and mirages. The wind weaving through its curves whistles like a hushed, insidious whisper in an ancient tongue: all that remains is to listen closely and discern the words, then separate truth from lies. It’s time to uncover what lies hidden within the mirrored labyrinths. The Wandering Graveyard of Ul-Karrat From time to time, travelers bold or mad enough to chart their route through the Weeping Savannas stumble upon the ghostly city of Ul-Karrat. Its buildings are hollow husks of elgalite, its wells brim with blackened cursed blood, and its inhabitants abandoned their mortal lives long ago. If you have even a shred of sanity left, flee from here at once—but beware: the city is not eager to let its guests go. And may all the gods you believe in spare you from seeing the dawn within its walls.  Margin ScribbleUl-Karrat is a wandering ghost city that sporadically appears in random locations across the Weeping Savannas. It lures travelers in with its invitingly open gates, seeking to add them to its “residents.” My personal choice for a moment of classic horror in a Bruna campaign. The Temple of the Star Cradle A collapsed observatory once built on the high slopes of the Lonely Fang. Its scholars once glimpsed into the future, invoking the wrath of Flueré and great punishments upon themselves. However, now the Mother of All Currents is in no position to punish anyone—or at least, if I were an adventurer, I would very much like to believe so. The Caves of Zul’ar Crater At the very border of the Cursed Blood Desert and the Fadjar Dunes rise the steep slopes of the Zul’ar Crater. A traveler daring enough to climb to its summit will see only a dark abyss before them, with a narrow trail winding down along the crater’s inner wall—a path leading into the depths of the earth.  Margin ScribbleBeneath the Zul’ar Crater lies a labyrinth of winding caves, their walls weeping inky-black tears of elgarim. Here, the memory of the cursed blood is particularly strong, and it does not hesitate to bring Bruna’s most terrifying events to life. Nur-Vara’d, the Tower of Eternal Watch Above the Pure Lake, on the border of Bryleah to the north of the Lonely Fang, rises the last of the beacons from ancient times: a tall tower, at whose peak a crimsonite lantern burns with an ominous reddish glow, day and night. Many wild wanderers gather here, drawn by the call of long-forgotten oaths: they will not attack travelers merely passing by, but woe to those who dare to cross the threshold.  Margin ScribbleIt is said that such beacons once repelled chimeras—or perhaps, they lured them in instead. Who knows? Perhaps this tower may yet reclaim its former purpose. ",

It&apos;s an enormous amount of tasks, so at this stage, many pages on this website contain only the most basic information – my thoughts and ideas that I am gradually turning into reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more details on what&apos;s coming next, you can check out the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;; I regularly publish current updates in the &lt;a href=\&quot;/extras/blog\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and most importhantly, I&apos;m always open to feedback. Even more than that – I&apos;ll be incredibly grateful for it! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have the time and inclination to read my notes, and if you happen to come up with any ideas, criticisms, or suggestions, please share them with me. All contact information is available on the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about#links\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page and in the header.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thank you for your

Even more than that – I&apos;ll be incredibly grateful for it! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have the time and inclination to read my notes, and if you happen to come up with any ideas, criticisms, or suggestions, please share them with me. All contact information is available on the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about#links\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page and in the header.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thank you for your

It&apos;s an enormous amount of tasks, so at this stage, many pages on this website contain only the most basic information – my thoughts and ideas that I am gradually turning into reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more details on what&apos;s coming next, you can check out the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;; I regularly publish current updates in the &lt;a href=\&quot;/extras/blog\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and most importhantly, I&apos;m always open to feedback. Even more than that – I&apos;ll be incredibly grateful for it! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have the time and inclination to read my notes, and if you happen to come up with any ideas, criticisms, or suggestions, please share them with me. All contact information is available on the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about#links\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page and in the header.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thank you for your
