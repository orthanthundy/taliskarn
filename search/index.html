Table of Content       TL;DRBryleahns – cold-blooded jungle dwellers:Appearance: fin-like ears, yellow-green skin, height from 4 to 6.5 feet (older = taller), no hair, cranial crest, large eyes, broad shoulders, barrel chests, females lack breasts;Lifespan: average 60-70 years;Typical occupations: hunters, alchemists, scholars, philosophers;Philosophy: \"Follow the current without altering it\";Racial themes: harmony with nature, warmth &amp; water, poisons;Weapons: tridents, blowguns;Cities: traditionalists \"weave\" homes on giant trees, reformers build human-like structures on elevated ground;Similar races from other universes: Merfolk from MtG, Tritons from... wherever you like :)D&amp;D Classes: Bryleahns work best as rangers, druids, alchemists, wizards (note: Taliscar has limited magic, but go wild if you want!).Appearance and Physiology Bryleahns are lean and wiry humanoids, perfectly adapted to life in the dense and humid jungles of Bryleah. In youth, they are short in stature: by adulthood (reached at their tenth spring), they barely reach 4-4.5 feet. However, their growth never ceases, and by old age, a Bryleahn may grow up to 6-6.5 feet. Their faces resemble humans’, but large eyes are shielded by a third transparent eyelid, cheeks are sunken, and small mouths are filled with tiny sharp teeth. Heads are large, hairless, with fin-like ears and a short crest stretching from the midpoint of a high forehead to the base of the skull. Bryleahn blood runs cold and azure, like Sanguama’s waters – hence their ears and crests are densely vascularized to aid temperature regulation. Their skin is thick, dotted with small bumps, and pale yellow in hue. Bryleahns have broad shoulders and strong arms, long fingers with webbing between the first phalanges. Their spines protrude slightly, forming a dorsal ridge, while agile, elongated legs resemble a cross between monkey and frog limbs. Bryleahns eat meat and fish, using plants only as seasonings, and cannot tolerate milk. Their young eat meat from birth, so females lack breasts and nipples, though all Fluere’s children have expanded ribcages with pronounced ribs. This allows them to hold their breath for 15-20 minutes. Culture Bryleahn temperaments mirror the currents shaped by Fluere: the young resemble rushing streams winding through foliage, while elders flow like a broad, unstoppable river. Most Bryleahns follow the Cult of Currents:  “Life is like the flow of the great Sanguama: it has its beginning and end. By weaving our fate’s currents with those of other beings, we journey from source to mouth, where we merge with the Mother’s waters.” They naturally seek harmony with the world rather than reshaping it, preserving primal nature. They are a people of philosophers and scholars who study life’s course through observation and contemplation. Note: Not all interpret the Cult’s tenets alike. For example, Bryleahns in the northern Shallows of the Scar reject clothing and tools, while those in the southern Azure Haven freely chop wood and fire clay. Still, all Bryleahns share a drive to maintain natural harmony. Material Culture All Bryleahns are born hunters. Silent as shadows, they prowl Sanguama’s lush banks or dive into its azure waters to ambush prey. They wield reed blowguns firing poison-tipped thorns with immense force, and harpoons: tridents with long hafts tipped with resin teeth from the lakrikel tree. This resin, specially treated and hardened, shapes other tools: knives, needles, fishhooks, and utensils. Hunters also use sticky vine nets. Bryleahns wear little clothing, covering only their loins with cloth-like wraps, but adorn themselves with lakrikel resin amulets, bark-and-vine bracelets, and wide woven belts holding pouches and vials. Southerners of Azure Haven add golden bangles and jewelry. Hunting Mask Every adult Bryleahn’s greatest treasure is their hunting mask. Bryleahns know the Forest Horror, Moss-Hide, is too cautious to attack face-to-face, so they craft eyes for the back of their heads. Masks are made of animal hides stretched over lakrikel-reinforced frames, ritually painted and adorned with two glowing lapis lazuli eyes – azure stones carried downstream by Sanguama. No Bryleahn leaves their settlement without this mask. Bryleahns are master alchemists, excelling in herbal medicine and advanced poisoncraft. They traditionally build settlements on tree trunks, weaving vines and branches without harming the host. Meza – the Woven City, rising on an island in Sanguama’s heart, is one of Malkona’s wonders, home to philosophers, scholars, and poets. Southern Bryleahns, lacking large trees, settle on high river hills, building human-style homes from wood, straw, and clay. –&gt; ",

    "wonders": {
      "title": "Wonders",
      "content": "In Taliskarn, there is no magic… yet it is full of wonders. I love this word, “wonders”—it carries a sense of the mysterious, astonishing, and unknowable, everything Taliskarn should be. You might encounter magic at every turn, but a “wonder” is always something utterly exceptional and unforgettable. This is the core idea I personally adhere to. Worldly Wonders A lazily drifting lord of the skies above the Great Steppes, the soaring tensur whale. A shadowboar dissolving into twilight haze. The vivid azure waters of the Chalice of the Source, rumored to heal even the gravest wounds. Ghosts of long-faded battles in the Weeping Savannahs. Ghastly nablings prowling the toxic mists of the Fetid Marshes. Taliskarn’s world brims with wonders, and many myths and legends hold truth—but whether encountering them firsthand will be a blessing or a curse… who can say?  For me, as a TTRPG player, the most cherished moment is encountering something new. I hate spoilers and \"dungeon crawls\" with constant bestiary checks. I love when the GM surprises me. I adore challenges I’ve never faced, creatures I’ve never heard of, riddles I’ve never solved. As a GM, I lean into this style: to immerse my players in constant discovery, making them pioneers of an uncharted world. Let them know the rules and concepts, but the details… Leave those to the GM—ask, and they’ll share after the session. Thus, in my campaigns, it’s simple: if wonders serve this vision, there can never be too many. The world must astonish—or rather, I want it to astonish.  You’ll encounter worldly wonders at every step: in descriptions of &lt;a href=”/malkona target=”_self”&gt;regions and cultures&lt;/a&gt;, peoples and customs, history, and future plans. These include marvelous locales, fantastical beasts, arcane materials, and manifestations of divine will—or divine caprice. Yet I strive to keep them grounded: neither Taliskarn of the Dark Era (~450-550 AR) nor Taliskarn of the New Dawn (~600 AR onward) has room for gods roaming Malkona, dragons scorching entire lands, or other overpowered entities. At least in my version—if you want otherwise, who’s to stop you ;) Mortal Wonders A steppe hunter whispers a quick prayer to ancestors, and their arrow flies true. A herbalist mixes healing sap with sacred ash on an open wound, murmuring pleas to forest spirits, and the pain fades. A Bryleahn, cornered by a Moss-Hide, hurls a thin-walled vial into its snarling maw, engulfing the beast in flames. Mortal Wonders are rare, perilous attempts by Taliskarn’s inhabitants to mimic divine deeds. This isn’t magic as commonly understood—it’s alchemy, technology, rituals, and spirit pacts, all with a price. Though the Age of Wonders has long passed, and the Progenitors no longer bless their children so freely, echoes of bygone eras still stir the blood of Malkona’s denizens. Ask around, and you’ll hear tales of miracle-workers: mighty warriors who single-handedly routed armies, cunning shamans who revived the dead, stormcallers who summoned Kaelesta’s wrath… Stories abound, but how much is true? You decide.  My answer: not much. I envision Taliskarn as a mysterious, wild, and perilous world—a frontier realm, unwelcoming and harsh. I want players to feel not as mighty heroes solving continental crises, but as ordinary (well, slightly tougher) adventurers, explorers, and rogues. Every fight is a trial, every mistake carries consequences.In my vision, mortal wonders exist but are strictly limited. No “magic shops in every village”—instead, “a few ancient scrolls of divine secrets held by a scholar in Meza”. Not “20 healing potions and a feather for change”, but “I heard a saltuar herbalist near the Steps brews curative draughts”. Not “I snap my fingers, and fireball flies”, but “I expend a rare, hard-won reagent”. Not “the goddess herself explained it”, but “a cryptic hint from a wandering spirit”.The same applies to warriors: not “I slay five foes per round”, but “three against me—odds are bad, better retreat”. In short, my Taliskarn is a dark, scarcity-ridden world where survival demands grit and accountability. That’s why I’m gonna use Fate Core for Taliskarn of the Dark Era—if D&amp;D fans insist on their system, they’ll endure a “poor” (by Faerûn standards) life. And yes, the greater the wonder, the steeper the cost. In every sense (e.g., access to resurrection might awaken Flumorn… but would you dare?).Yet Taliskarn itself offers all you need for mortal wonders—not magic—to thrive. We have gods, ancient secrets, exotic ingredients, mystical regions, and events: want classic D&amp;D 5e adventures? We’ve got those! Especially in Taliskarn of the New Dawn (details coming here). Work in Progress By the release of Taliskarn of the New Dawn—or sooner, if I launch a D&amp;D campaign—I plan to publish a list of D&amp;D spells (1st–3rd level) adapted for Taliskarn: flavor, context, ingredients, etc. Timeline? Not soon—the Dark Era comes first. But if you have ideas or drafts, please, share them. ",

Imagine a cold and grim northern highland. Giant moss-clad pines tower like a fortress wall, their somber crowns clawing at the leaden sky. Eternal mist swirls above the tranquil surface of white waters—colder than ice—of a lake lost deep within these woods. In the fog among the trees, the ghost of a predator’s shadow flickers now and then, and the oppressive silence is broken only by the distant howl of a wolf or the low, rumbling growl of unseen beasts. Hundreds of miles to the south stretch endless rust-red steppes. From horizon to horizon lies a rippling sea of copper grass, punctuated only by rare tabletop mountains. Across this parched land, herds of stone bison roam in their eternal migration, while raptors circle lazily overhead—there is no need to hurry here… until the rising thunder of talard hooves echoes and the piercing whistle of bone-adorned steeds signals the swift approach of nomads. The glittering jungles of Bryleah: a warm realm of currents—here, you never know from which tree a predatory moss_hide might leap or from where a poisoned dart might fly. The scorching sun of the Scarred Lands of Bruna. The toxic fogs of the Fetid Fens. The mind-numbing gloom of Noctaria. The fiery wastes of Flammarg’s Shards. All of this is Taliskarn: a harsh, unwelcoming, inhospitable, and often outright cruel world. A world crafted to challenge its players, plunging them into an atmosphere of perpetual struggle—for resources, for territory, for survival and freedom. A world where most of its lands remain blank spaces on an unwritten map—a map that, perhaps, awaits your pen. Welcome.

    "extras-stories-khurh-zan-ul": {
      "title": "Khurh-zan-ul",
      "content": "Margin ScribbleThis is an early version of the story’s prologue. I’m currently concentrating on the style and common principles of future texts (and trying to find good English names and terms). I’m not entirely happy with the pacing of the last third, but let it stay that way for now. I’ll come back to it in the future. Any feedback would be very welcome! Khurkh-zan-ul 8th month of the 480th year since the Return (3827th year since the Creation according to the Brilian calendar) Two and a half years had passed since the dry summer when Drenan, ruler of the great city of Varmego, united the scattered peoples of the verdant lands under the spear of the Father and bound them with His Word. The Unified Verda now stretched for thousands of miles: from the arid savannas of Bruna to the fertile shores of the Warm Sea, from the foothills of the Boundary Ridge—beyond which lay the lands of the beast-like Kyonnhs—to the coast of the Great Ocean. The wild Tondrantars, the calculating Kromrs, the fierce Malnurs, and even the cunning Varmars of Nordurbo—all had bowed to Drenan’s will. At least for now… Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhhu… Pop! A large bubble, quietly swelling above the lazily bubbling, foul-smelling brew in a stone bowl, burst loudly, distracting Barghyr from his sharpening. The youth had been toiling over a new needle since noon, and though the sun was slowly sinking toward the horizon, the work was far from done. Perhaps the task was moving so slowly because he was used to working deliberately and thoroughly, infusing every movement with conscious meaning. Or maybe the delay was due to the bones splashing in the cauldron: a large catfish had been caught in the nets that morning, and its bones would make fine belt clasps. Then again, it might have been the fact that, for the past two hours, young and lithe girls had been down by the shore rinsing canvas, and the wide windows of the workshop offered a truly mesmerizing view. Who could say? In any case, whatever Barghyr was doing—or daydreaming about—the loud pop above the cauldron made him flinch and snap back to reality. Rising from the table, he quickly crossed the room and peered anxiously into the stone bowl: had he overcooked it? Didn’t seem so… “Cooking up a storm?” The curtain of roughly tanned leather covering the entrance flew aside, letting in a noisy guest. “Phew! I was sure I was hungry, but if that’s your dinner, I’ve already eaten,” Ronan grimaced theatrically, waving a hand in front of his face. “Smells like something died. Yesterday. No, even earlier. And anyway…” He strode briskly to the workbench and leaned on it with his fists, peering out the window: “…aha, still here. So why were you staring into the cauldron? Had your fill already? Come on…”“Touch my balls, and I’ll knock you out,” Barghyr threatened lazily. Ronan snorted in disappointment, stopping a couple of steps away from the workshop owner, and raised his hands in mock surrender:“What can I do with you… Phew.” When the two stood side by side, it seemed there were no two more different people in all of Malcona. Barghyr, a descendant of the nomads of the great steppes, the Arydars, had already shot up so tall by the age of fourteen that he had to duck when entering some rooms. Slightly hunched, with awkwardly long arms and legs, he towered over Ronan like a gloomy old pine over a young ash tree. Barghyr’s long face, with its strong features, was tanned in the Arydar fashion, his narrow dark eyes looked at the world with assessing distrust, and his thick lips, with their slightly downturned corners, seemed perpetually on the verge of a dissatisfied grimace. Every movement of his radiated visible reluctance, and he tended to view everything around him with pessimistic skepticism, searching first and foremost for flaws, threats, and annoyances. Ronan, on the other hand, was his complete opposite: a child of mixed blood, he had drawn the lucky ticket at birth, inheriting only the best from both parents. Neither tall nor short, at twelve he was already built like a young Father: stately, broad-shouldered, predatorily agile, with clearly defined muscles beneath his bronze skin—give him another year or two, and many men of Nordurbo would have reason to worry. His face retained the smooth, even slightly rounded features typical of the Prymars, but added the sharpness and expressiveness characteristic of the Arydar people. A straight nose, a strong chin, thin, well-defined lips, and slightly narrow, almond-shaped eyes with an amber-golden hue that gazed at the world with unwavering, energetic curiosity. Add to this that Barghyr kept his black, coarse hair cut short, growing a small, neat beard, while Ronan gathered his chestnut locks with a golden sheen into a loose knot at the back of his head or left them completely loose. Barghyr wore the traditional leather clothing of the nomads, roughly tanned and generously adorned with intricately carved bone symbols, while Ronan preferred the usual Prymar togas or loose trousers and shirts made of soft fabric dyed with Noctidian purple, and his only adornments were a family amulet and a wide bracelet on his left wrist. In short, as mentioned earlier, you’d be hard-pressed to find two more different people—but such trifles didn’t bother these two in the slightest. Shaking his head in disappointment, Ronan glanced around the room and plopped down on the nearest chest. “A caravan from the Kromrs arrived. They brought spices from Bruna, a bit of this, a bit of that… And a little silver from the Kyonnhs.” The boy paused dramatically, watching for Barghyr’s reaction. “Uh-huh,” the dark-skinned youth nodded, bending over the cauldron again. “Heard ‘bout it.”“Heard about it!?” Ronan leapt up from the chest, bounded over to the craftsman, and slapped him on the back, enunciating clearly: “They brought silver. From the Kyonnhs. Sil-ver.”“Uh-huh,” Barghyr agreed again, not taking his eyes off the cauldron. “Like I said, I heard.”“You’re impossible…” Ronan took a deep breath, choked on the stench rising from the bowl, and broke into a coughing fit. “Cough-cough, ugh! Why do I even bother coming to this stinking hole of yours!? You’ve got a perfectly good room in the house! You can see the girls from there too!!!” Barghyr ignored this remark. After damping the fire under the cauldron, he carefully covered it with a heavy turtle-shell lid, returned to his table, sat down on the stool, and, leaning his elbows on his knees, stared intently into Ronan’s shimmering, enthusiastic golden eyes. After a few seconds of this staring contest, the dapper boy shook his head in mock offense: “You’re so dense! Listen up: the Kromrs. Brought. Silver. That means…”“It means they went north through Coppergrass,” Barghyr said with a heavy sigh. “To the Steps. Traded with the Kyonnhs. And came back. Right through Tondrantar territory.”“Exactly!” Ronan enthusiastically slapped his thighs, jumping to his feet again. “Precisely! So, they’re following…”“So, they’re following the Word and aren’t allowed to fight among themselves,” the host continued in the same displeased tone.“Well! Isn’t that amazing!?”“Amazing. I’m sure Mongar-suru likes it too. And when he comes to Shu-Guranbor for the winter, he’ll be in a good mood. And no one will have any trouble because of it. Right?”“Mongar-suru and all the other Tondrans will have to deal with it!” Ronan paced back and forth across the room, energetically waving his arms. “The world is changing, don’t you get it, Barghyr!? The wind is changing! And that means…”“It means there’s a storm coming.” Ronan groaned in frustration, rolling his eyes to the ceiling as if asking, “Why me, Father?” But then his mood shifted abruptly. He darted over to Barghyr, planted his hands on the table on either side of the seated youth, and grinned slyly right in his face: “And that too. That too! That’s exactly why I need you around, to whine in my ear and remind me how bad everything really is. So I don’t get carried away. And you,” Ronan straightened up and spread his arms in bewilderment, “for some reason, are never there. Why didn’t you come to the caravan meeting, huh?”“Because a smooth-skinned youth has no place at a council of men,” Barghyr replied with stone-cold calm, and Ronan winced as if from a toothache.“Again… You’re not a youth, you’re my rider! My senior rider! Isn’t that enough?”“No.” Barghyr scowled, raised a clenched fist in front of him, and began unfolding his fingers one by one: “A rider is a warrior. A warrior is a man. I’m not a man. I can’t be a warrior. I can’t be a rider.”“You’re impossible…” Ronan groaned again and irritably waved his hand toward the western wall. “That’s over there! But you live here! My riders will be whoever I choose, and let anyone dare mutter a word about those barbutar rituals!” The dark-skinned boy stubbornly furrowed his brow and rose threateningly from his seat:“I. I’ll have something to say about those rituals. I’m a tribesman of the Arydar tribes. These are my rituals, got it!?” For a few seconds, they glared at each other fiercely until Ronan finally gave in:“Just kick me already,” he grumbled, collapsing onto a stack of tanned hides in the corner. “Barbutar through and through.” For a while, silence hung in the room, broken only by the sullen grumbling of the two boys who had once again quarreled. This wasn’t the first time they’d argued about this, and Barghyr remained steadfast: true to his Arydar blood, he refused to call himself a man until he had undergone Khurkh-zan-ul. Khurkh-zan-ul—the rite of passage—was the most important ritual for any boy born into the Arydar tribes of the Great Plains. The harsh nomadic tribe clearly divided its men into -khur—boys, and -khar—grown men, and the line separating the two was precisely Khurkh-zan-ul. It took place in the final days of summer, when the beasts of the plains were well-fed and strong. At sunset, a father would come to his son and present him with a handcrafted ancestral talisman, the Sakhyr: a vertebra of the tribe’s totem animal, adorned with intricate runes invoking the ancestors. From that moment until the very end of Khurkh-zan-ul, the future man would not utter a single word. In silence, he would gather his bow and knife, leave the encampment, and head to the nearest sacred spring. There, he would spend a sleepless night without food or water, listening to the music of the steppe wind and calming his spirit. At dawn, the youth would set out into the steppe, tracking his future guardian. The stronger the beast he found, the more powerful a protector it would become, and the stronger his entire lineage would grow. But the boy would be cautious: the animal must be defeated openly and honestly, relying only on his bow, arrows, and courage—traps and trickery would insult the free spirit of the beast, anger it, and instead of gaining its protection, he would only invite misfortune. After succeeding in the hunt, the youth would return to the encampment with his prize. If the beast was too large for a single talard to carry its carcass, the hunter would take only the largest and strongest bone—and he would not forget to dip the Sakhyr into the hot blood, staining it crimson. The tribe would greet the hunter with jubilation. The bone he brought would be split into two parts: the smaller piece would become the first link of his Tuur-Khurrah—a talisman chain bearing the vertebrae of his guardians. The larger part would form the base of the Krynar: a long knife adorned with prayer runes, a symbol of an Arydar man’s dignity. Once the Tuur-Khurrah and Krynar were ready, the shaman would inscribe the youth’s first adult tattoo onto his skin: symbols of the defeated beast and the lineage strengthened by this victory. Then, the boy would speak his first adult words, the words of a man: Issar-Khurrah, the “oath to the bones.” The Sakhyr he brought, stained with the blood of the totem beast, would be added to the ancestral chain of the entire lineage, and the new man would take his place among the Arydars. Faithful to tradition and heritage, Barghyr stubbornly wished to follow the path of his ancestors—and Ronan, for the most part, had no issue with it… except for the fact that the stubborn boy didn’t truly have a lineage of his own. Barghyr was an orphan, the adopted son of Varek, the current ruler of Nordurbo and all the Varmars. Though the Varmars had drifted away from classical Prymar culture over the centuries since their separation from Varmego, they still adhered to the same principle regarding adoption as the Shield City: adopted sons or daughters became junior to biological children or those adopted earlier, but otherwise enjoyed the same rights and treatment. This made Barghyr a full-fledged brother to Ronan—and a beloved one at that—while also, in Ronan’s understanding, freeing the stubborn boy from the need to follow Arydar traditions and rules. Instead, it obligated him to abide by the rules established in Varek’s family. Barghyr fully agreed with the latter part, but as for the former… Ronan sighed heavily: “Alright, let’s go with a different wind. Sit still and keep quiet. Don’t say a word. Got it, tall one?” Barghyr raised his eyebrows in confusion as the curly-haired boy, rummaging behind the fold of his toga, deftly tossed something onto his lap. The lanky youth looked down, and his pupils widened in shock. “If you laugh, I’ll kill you,” Ronan warned. “Or at least try to maim you.” There was, admittedly, plenty to laugh about: the piece of bone that had landed on Barghyr’s lap was so poorly crafted that even an apprentice would have done better. A jagged, uneven edge, crudely scratched runes… It was a hack job, plain and simple. But laughter was the last thing on Barghyr’s mind: resting on his knees was half of Ronan’s ancestral amulet, made from the bone of the lord of the skies, the soaring Tensus whale. A more powerful guardian was hard to imagine… The youth looked up at his brother with stunned eyes, meeting his wide grin. “It’s mine, all mine,” Ronan said, showing the other half still hanging from a leather cord around his neck. “Just don’t blurt anything out, or you’ll ruin it. We’d have to wait another year.” Barghyr frowned, and the curly-haired boy stretched contentedly, raising his hands in a forbidding gesture: “No-no, keep your mouth shut! Open your ears instead—I’ll answer all your questions right now. First, it’s my amulet, my guardian, and my lineage! I can do what I want with it. Second, the Sakhyr doesn’t have to be given by a father—any senior member of the lineage can do it. According to our traditions, I’m older than you, right?” Barghyr, still sitting stiff as a rod, hesitated, then nodded uncertainly. “Exactly! Next: why isn’t the Warm Sea a sacred spring? Your idea is that lakes give life to the steppe, and the sea is a big lake. It gives life to us. And there’s plenty of wind here—Kaelesta loves the sea as much as the plains!” Ronan waited for another thoughtful nod, then leaned in conspiratorially and whispered loudly: “And they’ve seen traces of a shadowboar in the Shattered Bay.” He winked at the still-dazed craftsman, slapped him on the shoulder, and headed for the exit, tossing back an encouraging farewell: “Don’t shit your pants, and may the Father watch over you.” The Evening of the Next Day It took Barghyr almost an entire day to track down the shadowboar. These wild boars dwell only in the dense forests on the very edge of the Noctarian Wastes: blessed by the ghostly light of the Moon-Protector, Tranka, they skillfully conceal their presence in the shadows, avoiding the bright rays of the sun at all costs. During the day, the Shadowboar rests in deep pits beneath tree roots. Knowing this—and also that the delicate eyes of these creatures cannot tolerate light—hunters approach such dens during the hot midday hours and throw inside a burning clump of grass, oil-soaked tow, or simply a couple of torches. Awakened and blinded, the boar flies into a rage and charges out mindlessly, straight into the bright sunlight and the sharp spears of the Varmars. Alas, Barghyr found the den only at sunset, he was alone, and in his hands he held not a spear but a sturdy horn bow. The weapon with which you take down your guardian beast is the one it will respect, the one it will share its strength with, and for an Arydar, there is no weapon more significant or beloved than the bow. But arrows are not the best choice when an enraged boar is charging straight at you, especially one shrouded in shadowy mirage. The hunter knew all this perfectly well, but the mere thought of missing his chance and shaming himself in the eyes of his ancestors made the youth tremble. After a moment’s hesitation, Barghyr finally made up his mind. Kissing the Sakhyr, he took the oil-soaked tow from his belt and reached for his tinderbox… “Have you lost your mind!?” Ronan hissed in a fierce whisper, rolling out of the thick bushes to the right. “You’re going after a boar with a bow!?” Startled, Barghyr turned to his uninvited companion in indignation. “Here!” Ronan shoved a long spear with a thick shaft into his brother’s hands. Barghyr frowned and pushed the spear back.“Take it, I said!!!” Ronan was so furious he even started to whistle. “It won’t even notice your arrow, don’t be an idiot!” Barghyr stubbornly shook his head. “Take the damn spear!” Ronan finally roared louder than he should have, and a low, threatening growl answered from the dark hole beneath the roots of an old tree. The scuffling boys froze, slowly turning toward the den, now barely visible in the rapidly deepening twilight, and spotted two glimmering points of light.“SPEAR!!!!” Ronan screamed at the top of his lungs, his face pale. With an angry grunt, the boar charged at them. Barghyr shoved his brother aside, grabbed the spear, and barely managed to plant it in front of him, bracing the butt against the ground. Well, almost managed… With a ramming blow, the frenzied beast slammed into the hunter, and even the dim light of dusk faded for Barghyr. Some Time LaterShhhurkh. Shhhurkh. Shhhurkh. The scraping sounds broke into Barghyr’s consciousness along with the pain. His head was spinning terribly—apparently, Ronan had given him a brew of sorrowweed… How bad must the pain be if even under the influence of the drug he felt like howling? He groaned weakly and opened his eyes. Above him, the treetops jerked past, and here and there, patches of the dark night sky peeked through. Shhhurkh, the hastily assembled drag made of branches creaked one last time, and the world finally came to a standstill. Between the sky and Barghyr appeared the swaying, exhausted figure of his brother: Ronan dropped to his knees beside the wounded boy and leaned in close, trying to catch his breath: “You’re so… Barghyr-khar… Heavy,” he coughed heavily but stubbornly continued. “And stupid. And heavy… And… Stupid… Almighty Father, I… Nothing… We’re almost at the shore.” The hunter shuddered and weakly stirred, trying to sit up. “Stay down,” Ronan, still coughing, pressed down on him. “And shut up. The boar’s done for.” The boy showed Barghyr his own hand, where the blood-soaked Sakhir dangled, tied with a cord. “We’ll get there soon,” Ronan tried to stand but swayed and fell back down, “and everything will be fine. We’ll draw you… a tattoo… write… heavy… and stupid…” With an incredible effort of will, Barghyr forced his body to move. He propped himself up on his elbow, grabbed Ronan by the back of the head with his other hand, pressed his brother’s forehead to his own, and hoarsely, barely audibly, spat out his first adult words: “You’re… stupid… You’re… dragging… and I’m… riding.” Exhausted, he fell back onto the drag and slipped back into unconsciousness with a satisfied smile, accompanied by his brother’s loud laughter.

    "extras-stories-myth": {
      "title": "Myth",
      "content": "The Myth of Taliskarn Before the Beginning, there was the Ocean, and the Ocean was still. He slumbered a long sleep in the darkness of the Void, until the rays of the Sun touched his silent waters. At their light, the Ocean shuddered and drew a deep breath, awakening. From his tremor was born Fluere, Mother of All Currents, and from his breath, Kaelesta, Mistress of the Winds. The Ocean rejoiced as he beheld them, and thus began… The Time of Beginnings The Ocean granted his daughters freedom and tenderness, forbidding them only one thing — never to descend into his dark depths, where the long-slumbering flame lay hidden. The sisters were obedient and joyful: Kaelesta sang carefree songs in the heavens, and in harmony with that song, Fluere wove the flowing streams of water. For an eternity, it was so — until Solkalor, son of the Sun, beheld the graceful Fluere from his radiant heights. He loved her at first sight, descended into the Ocean’s realm, and she loved him in return. From their union, the first life took root in the Ocean’s waters. Thus began… The Time of Creation Solkalor and Fluere rejoiced, the Ocean looked upon their union with benevolence, and only Kaelesta grew sorrowful. Less and less did Fluere rise to meet her sister, and ever more wistful became the song of the skies. The Ocean, hearing his daughter’s grief, sighed, trembled, and parted his waters. Thus, the lands were formed. But the barren rocks unveiled by the Ocean were cold and lifeless. Seeing this, Solkalor shared his warmth with Kaelesta, but her gentle hands could not hold it — she let it slip into the Void. And so, Kaelesta’s loneliness deepened further. Fluere saw this and could not bear it. She broke the one command of her father, descended into the deepest abyss, and stirred the slumbering waters. Their movement awakened Ferrude, lord of Ardenféra, the Molten Depths. He struck the vault of the earth with his great hammer, and heaved the undersea stone. A thousand blazing craters burst forth upon the Ocean’s surface, warming the frozen waters and bringing heat to the land. Then the Ocean’s wrath turned upon his beloved daughter, and he was filled with turmoil. Great waves rolled across the seas, the land shook and cracked. Thus, the continents were formed. In his fury, the Ocean drove Fluere toward the nearest shore and hurled his body against the cliffs. His rage surged over the lands, and they would have drowned entirely, but Fluere wrapped her arms around them, shielding them with her own form. Mighty waves crashed upon her back, battering and tormenting her, yet she did not let them pass. Thus was born the great current of Amplectar, the Mother’s Embrace. Seeing her sister’s torment, Kaelesta wept bitterly. Her tears fell upon the land, becoming rivers and lakes. Solkalor sought to comfort her, warming her with his light, and from that warmth, many plants and beasts were born. On her knees, Kaelesta begged her father to forgive Fluere, but the wrathful Ocean would not listen. In despair, she soared into the sky and flew to the highest burning mountain. There, she fell to her knees before Ferrude himself, pleading for his aid. The mighty Ferrude agreed, but only if Kaelesta would give him her love. And so it was, and from their union were born the Flammars, the Flame-Winged. The Lord of the Molten Depths kept his word. He strode through his subterranean domain, drawing closer to the land, and once more struck the vault of the earth with his great hammer. The land surged and heaved around the great mountain of Ferrir, and from the waters rose blazing cliffs, shielding the land from the Ocean’s fury. These lands Ferrude gifted to his children, the offspring of Kaelesta, and they named them Flammarg. Then Solkalor, seeing Fluere’s weary form, lifted her in his arms and carried her to the green lands, where he hid her in a deep, cool lake. Thick blood flowed from Fluere’s wounds, staining the lake and the river it birthed with a sapphire hue, filling them with life. From these waters arose the children of Fluere, and they named the river Sanguama, the Mother’s Blood. Their lands they called Bryleah, the Shining Realm, and themselves, the Bryleahns. Thus began… The Time of Birth Yet the Flammars soon found Flammarg too confining; they had inherited their father’s tempestuous spirit and their mother’s love of freedom, and they would not be bound to a single land. They came to Bryleah, but they were rough and reckless. The Bryleahns wept, and Fluere grieved at the sight of her children’s suffering. She cast the Flammars back to their fiery mountains. Kaelesta saw this and sorrowed. She offered Fluere a pact — to divide all the lands equally. But Fluere replied, “Let your children remain in the lands of flame, and mine on the shining shores, but let no others walk the rest.” Thus did Bryleahns and Flammars become enemies, and Fluere and Kaelesta grew estranged. From that time, those lands were called Malkona, the Land of Strife. Anger took root in Kaelesta’s heart, and she bore a silent grudge. On a moonless night, she took on the form of Fluere and lay with Solkalor, bearing him two children: Aurehjo, the golden-haired giant, and Tranqa, the frail, pale-skinned maiden. She gifted them lands to the east of Bryleah and commanded them to people those lands with children of their own — ones who might one day aid the Flammars in vanquishing the Bryleahns. Aurehjo fulfilled his mother’s will. He begot children in his own likeness — tall and mighty — and named them Prymars, the Firstborn. Tranqa, in turn, gave life to a pale-skinned, fragile people like herself and called them Pulcars, the Beautiful. But the moment the Sun’s rays touched the Pulcars, they cried out in agony, writhing in torment. The Sun’s heat seared their white skin, burning both Tranqa and her children. Tranqa spread her arms wide, shielding her children, and ascended high into the sky. Kaelesta rushed after her on the wind, pleading, crying for her to stop, but her daughter would not listen. The ethereal wings of Tranqa burned away, and she remained forever hovering above the land, sheltering her people from the Sun’s wrath. Thus was born Noctaria, the Nightlands, and her children became the Noctides. Tranqa herself never set foot upon the land again, and the wondrous power within her offspring began to wane. Aurehjo’s children, however, were like Solkalor — fearless before the Sun, fertile, and strong-willed. They swiftly spread across the new lands and flourished. Solkalor saw all that had transpired and realized Kaelesta had deceived him. Rage overtook him. He forged a spear of pure light and hurled it at Tranqa, but the Mistress of Winds cried out in terror and shielded her daughter. The spear pierced her through, leaving a great wound. From that moment, the Sun above that place burned red with fury, and the Prymars who dwelled beneath it darkened under its fiery glare — thus were born the Brunars, the Brown-Skinned. Kaelesta, overcome with fury, soared toward the flaming mountains, gathered fire upon the winds of the sky, and carried it to Bryleah. The forests blazed, the Bryleahns screamed in agony, and Fluere trembled. She cast her waters over the shining lands, shielding her children from the raging wrath of the Storm Mistress. Seeing this, Solkalor’s fury burned ever hotter. He turned his blazing gaze upon Aurehjo’s children, seeking to destroy them. He dried up their rivers and lakes, withered their plants, and smote their beasts. Some of the Prymars fled into the deep forests, where their skin grew lighter and their hair darkened — thus they became the Saltuars, the Forest Dwellers. Others remained upon their scorched lands, enduring all that befell them, though they grew smaller in stature — these became the Arydars, the Children of Drought. Aurehjo beheld the suffering of his offspring and was enraged. He seized his father upon his shoulders and cast him down to the earth, shattering it all the way to Ardenfera, the Molten Depths. From the gaping wound in the land burst forth Ferrude’s burning breath, consuming the surrounding lands, parching them, turning them to dust. Thus were born the deserts. So great was the upheaval that Malkona split into three, its sundered lands drifting apart. Only then did Solkalor and Aurehjo cease their battle. Each took hold of the broken earth from opposite ends and pushed it together once more. The lands clashed, crashing against each other, rising into jagged peaks. Thus were born the mountains. Father and son gazed upon Malkona, now divided by its peaks, and realized there was nothing left to fight over. Fluere raged in vain, for the god of light had calmed and could no longer lift his hand against his own children. Pensive, he turned to the now-silent Kaelesta and bid her lift him to the highest summit. There he remained, lost in thought. From the thoughts of Solkalor were born gray-skinned and wise children, and they called themselves Kyommndaih, which means “The Prudent Tribe.” As for Kaelesta herself, fearing the consequences of her deeds, she ascended even higher into the sky, vowing never to return to the earth. Then Fluere grew wrathful beyond measure. She withdrew her waters from the lands and commanded her children to march eastward and strike down the children of Aurehjo. Thus, the Bryleahns waged war against the Prymars, Brunars, Arydars, and Saltuars, and the conflict lasted long. Golden-haired Solkalor and the Mother of Currents bestowed their people with great gifts, enabling them to perform wondrous and terrible feats alike. Thus began… The Time of Miracles But the forsaken children of Kaelesta grieved, and in their hearts, fury began to burn. The Flammars multiplied in great numbers, forging dreadful weapons in the molten depths of the mountains, and they descended upon the lands of Malkona like an unstoppable tide. Fluere and Aurehjo beheld the wrath of the flame-winged ones and understood that their children could not withstand such fury. Thus, they forged not peace, but a truce. From Aurehjo, Fluere bore Fluaht, the Patron of Pure Waters, and Kustopha, the Keeper of the Source. To her daughter, she entrusted the care of the living river Sanguama, and to her son, the fate of her children, the Bryleahns. Then, Fluere descended back into the sea, going forth to meet the raging Ocean. Enraged, the Ocean-father drove his defiant daughter toward the shores, striking her against the fiery cliffs of Flammarg, shattering them. Mighty waves poured into the blazing abyss, the sea boiled, and Flammarg was no more. With the last of her strength, Fluere embraced Malkona once more with a warm current. Yet, she never forgave Solkalor’s betrayal: along the shores of Bryleah, she placed her hands close; by the lands of Aurehjo, she kept them at a distance; and at the farthest edge, she did not close them at all. Thus came to be the warm shores and the cold shores. As for Aurehjo, he gathered the Prymars around him and descended into the molten depths of Ardenfera to subdue the raging Ferrude. To the Brunars and Arydars, he decreed that they should honor the deeds of their ancestors but shape their lives as they wished — yet the Saltuars did not emerge from their forests to follow their father. And so, he named them Humans. Fluaht, mourning his mother’s fate, sought to bestow upon the Bryleahns all manner of gifts and wonders. He generously revealed to them the secrets of alchemy and the world, teaching them the mysteries of healing wounds and prolonging life. Kustopha, seeing this, said: “No river flows forever; every current must have its beginning and its end.” Her brother opposed her, and thus Fluaht and Kustopha quarreled. Kustopha cast out her brother and his followers from the blooming shores of Sanguama into the misty, fetid swamps. Overcome by sorrow, their minds darkened, their bodies and thoughts became twisted. Thus were born Flumorn and the Nablings. Exhausted from her quarrel with her brother, Kustopha descended into the Lake of the Source and fell into a deep slumber. Thus, the progenitors of the Bryleahns abandoned Malkona, and the wondrous power within their children began to wane. The forsaken Bryleahns grew fearful and restless. They climbed into the mountains, calling loudly upon Solkalor, but it was not he who answered them — only the beast-like and fearsome Kyommndaih emerged to meet them. The Bryleahns found their name difficult to pronounce and instead began calling their neighbors Kyönnhi. The Kyönnhi proclaimed that they named their progenitor Dh’Fhalbh, meaning “The Departed.” Solkalor had left Malkona, and his children lived by their own wisdom, placing no faith in their forebears, shaping their lands as they saw fit by their own will and desire. The beast-like ones showed the Bryleahns their stone cities, their deep mines, and their strange, wondrous tools. The Bryleahns grew even more afraid and did not trust the Kyönnhi, believing they must have slain Solkalor and, through his flesh, gained the power to perform miracles. Gathering all their strength, the Bryleahns ascended the mountains in force, but the Kyönnhi drove them back to the shore. The Kyommndaihh seized the Valley of the Source and settled there, advancing no further. From that time on, the Bryleahns were forced to come before the Kyönnhi in supplication, begging for permission to see Kustopha. Meanwhile, the Humans and the Noctides lived in their own lands, waging no great conflicts against one another and no longer witnessing the light of the progenitors. Thus began the Dark Time. ",

All contact information is available on the &lt;a href=\&quot;/about#links\&quot; target=\&quot;_self\&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thank you for your interest in
